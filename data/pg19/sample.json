They sat on the coolest corner in\nPort Said, their table commanding both the cross-way of Chareh Sultan el\nOsman, and the short, glaring vista of desert dust and starved young\nacacias which led to the black hulks of shipping in the Canal. From the\nBar la Poste came orchestral strains--\"Ai nostri monti\"--performed by a\npiano indoors and two violins on the pavement. The sounds contended with\na thin, scattered strumming of cafe mandolins, the tinkle of glasses,\nthe steady click of dominoes and backgammon; then were drowned in the\nharsh chatter of Arab coolies who, all grimed as black as Nubians, and\nshouldering spear-headed shovels, tramped inland, their long tunics\nstiff with coal-dust, like a band of chain-mailed Crusaders lately\ncaught in a hurricane of powdered charcoal. Athwart them, Parisian\ngowns floated past on stout Italian forms; hulking third-class\nAustralians, in shirtsleeves, slouched along toward their mail-boat,\nhugging whiskey bottles, baskets of oranges, baskets of dates; British\nsoldiers, khaki-clad for India, raced galloping donkeys through the\ncrowded and dusty street. It was mail-day, and gayety flowed among the\ntables, under the thin acacias, on a high tide of Amer Picon.\n\nThrough the inky files of the coaling-coolies burst an alien and\nbewildered figure. He passed unnoticed, except by the filthy little Arab\nbootblacks who swarmed about him, trotting, capering, yelping\ncheerfully: \"Mista Ferguson!--polish, finish!--can-can--see nice Frencha\ngirl--Mista McKenzie, Scotcha fella from Dublin--smotta picture--polish,\nfinish!\"--undertoned by a squabbling chorus. But presently, studying his\nface, they cried in a loud voice, \"Nix! Alles!\" and left him, as one not\ndesiring polish.\n\n\"German, that chap,\" drawled the captain of the Tsuen-Chau, lazily,\nnoticing the uncertain military walk of the young man's clumsy legs, his\nuncouth clothes, his pale visage winged by blushing ears of coral pink.\n\n\"The Eitel's in, then,\" replied Cesare. And they let the young Teuton\nvanish in the vision of mixed lives.\n\nDown the lane of music and chatter and drink he passed slowly, like a\nman just wakened,--assailed by Oriental noise and smells, jostled by the\nraces of all latitudes and longitudes, surrounded and solitary, unheeded\nand self-conscious. With a villager's awkwardness among crowds, he made\nhis way to a German shipping-office.\n\n\"Dispatches for Rudolph Hackh?\" he inquired, twisting up his blond\nmoustache, and trying to look insolent and peremptory, like an\nemployer of men.\n\n\"There are none, sir,\" answered an amiable clerk, not at all impressed.\n\nAbashed once more in the polyglot street, still daunted by his first\nplunge into the foreign and the strange, he retraced his path, threading\nshyly toward the Quai Francois Joseph. He slipped through the barrier\ngate, signaled clumsily to a boatman, crawled under the drunken little\nawning of the dinghy, and steered a landsman's course along the shining\nCanal toward the black wall of a German mail-boat. Cramping the Arab's\noar along the iron side, he bumped the landing-stage. Safe on deck, he\nbecame in a moment stiff and haughty, greeting a fellow passenger here\nand there with a half-military salute. All afternoon he sat or walked\nalone, unapproachable, eyeing with a fierce and gloomy stare the\nsqualid front of wooden houses on the African side, the gray desert\nglare of Asia, the pale blue ribbon of the great Canal stretching\nsouthward into the unknown.\n\nHe composed melancholy German verses in a note-book. He recalled famous\nexiles--Camoens, Napoleon, Byron--and essayed to copy something of all\nthree in his attitude. He cherished the thought that he, clerk at\ntwenty-one, was now agent at twenty-two, and traveling toward a house\nwith servants, off there beyond the turn of the Canal, beyond the curve\nof the globe. But for all this, Rudolph Hackh felt young, homesick,\ntimid of the future, and already oppressed with the distance, the age,\nthe manifold, placid mystery of China.\n\nToward that mystery, meanwhile, the ship began to creep. Behind her,\nhouses, multi- funnels, scrubby trees, slowly swung to blot out\nthe glowing Mediterranean and the western hemisphere. Gray desert banks\nclosed in upon her strictly, slid gently astern, drawing with them to\nthe vanishing-point the bright lane of traversed water. She gained the\nBitter Lakes; and the red conical buoys, like beads a-stringing, slipped\non and added to the two converging dotted lines.\n\n\"Good-by to the West!\" thought Rudolph. As he mourned sentimentally at\nthis lengthening tally of their departure, and tried to quote\nappropriate farewells, he was deeply touched and pleased by the sadness\nof his emotions. \"Now what does Byron say?\"\n\nThe sombre glow of romantic sentiment faded, however, with the sunset.\nThat evening, as the ship glided from ruby coal to ruby coal of the\ngares, following at a steady six knots the theatric glare of her\nsearch-light along arsenically green cardboard banks, Rudolph paced the\ndeck in a mood much simpler and more honest. In vain he tried the\nhalf-baked philosophy of youth. It gave no comfort; and watching the\nclear desert stars of two mysterious continents, he fell prey to the\nunbounded and unintelligible complexity of man's world. His own career\nseemed no more dubious than trivial.\n\nSucceeding days only strengthened this mood. The Red Sea passed in a\ndream of homesickness, intolerable heat, of a pale blue surface\nstretched before aching eyes, and paler strips of pink and gray coast,\nfaint and distant. Like dreams, too, passed Aden and Colombo; and then,\nsuddenly, he woke to the most acute interest.\n\nHe had ignored his mess-mates at their second-class table; but when the\nnew passengers from Colombo came to dinner, he heard behind him the\nswish of stiff skirts, felt some one brush his shoulder, and saw,\nsliding into the next revolving chair, the vision of a lady in white.\n\n\"_Mahlzeit_\" she murmured dutifully. But the voice was not German.\nRudolph heard her subside with little flouncings, and felt his ears grow\nwarm and red. Delighted, embarrassed, he at last took sufficient courage\nto steal side-glances.\n\nThe first showed her to be young, fair-haired, and smartly attired in\nthe plainest and coolest of white; the second, not so young, but very\ncharming, with a demure downcast look, and a deft control of her spoon\nthat, to Rudolph's eyes, was splendidly fastidious; at the third, he was\nshocked to encounter the last flitting light of a counter-glance, from\nlarge, dark-blue eyes, not devoid of amusement.\n\n\"She laughs at me!\" fumed the young man, inwardly. He was angry,\nconscious of those unlucky wing-and-wing ears, vexed at his own\nboldness. \"I have been offensive. She laughs at me.\" He generalized from\nlong inexperience of a subject to which he had given acutely interested\nthought: \"They always do.\"\n\nAnger did not prevent him, however, from noting that his neighbor\ntraveled alone, that she must be an Englishwoman, and yet that she\ndiffused, somehow, an aura of the Far East and of romance. He shot many\na look toward her deck-chair that evening, and when she had gone below,\nstrategically bought a cigar, sat down in the chair to light it, and by\na carefully shielded match contrived to read the tag that fluttered on\nthe arm: \"B. Forrester, Hongkong.\"\n\nAfterward he remembered that by early daylight he might have read it for\nnothing; and so, for economic penance, smoked to the bitter end, finding\nthe cigar disagreeable but manly. At all events, homesickness had\nvanished in a curious impatience for the morrow. Miss Forrester: he\nwould sit beside Miss Forrester at table. If only they both were\ntraveling first-class!--then she might be a great lady. To be enamored\nof a countess, now--A cigar, after all, was the proper companion of\nbold thoughts.\n\nAt breakfast, recalling her amusement, he remained silent and wooden. At\ntiffin his heart leaped.\n\n\"You speak English, I'm sure, don't you?\" Miss Forrester was saying, in\na pleasant, rather drawling voice. Her eyes were quite serious now, and\nindeed friendly. Confusion seized him.\n\n\"I have less English to amuse myself with the ladies,\" he answered\nwildly. Next moment, however, he regained that painful mastery of the\ntongue which had won his promotion as agent, and stammered: \"Pardon. I\nwould mean, I speak so badly as not to entertain her.\"\n\n\"Indeed, you speak very nicely,\" she rejoined, with such a smile as no\nwoman had ever troubled to bestow on him. \"That will be so pleasant,\nfor my German is shocking.\"\n\nDazed by the compliment, by her manner of taking for granted that future\nconversation which had seemed too good to come true, but above all by\nher arch, provoking smile, Rudolph sat with his head in a whirl, feeling\nthat the wide eyes of all the second-cabiners were penetrating the\ntumultuous secret of his breast. Again his English deserted, and left\nhim stammering. But Miss Forrester chatted steadily, appeared to\nunderstand murmurs which he himself found obscure, and so restored his\nconfidence that before tiffin was over he talked no less gayly, his\nhonest face alight and glowing. She taught him the names of the strange\nfruits before them; but though listening and questioning eagerly, he\ncould not afterward have told loquat from pumelo, or custard-apple\nfrom papaya.\n\nNor could this young man, of methodical habits, ever have told how long\ntheir voyage lasted. It passed, unreal and timeless, in a glorious mist,\na delighted fever: the background a blur of glossy white bulkheads and\niron rails, awnings that fluttered in the warm, languorous winds, an\ninfinite tropic ocean poignantly blue; the foreground, Miss Forrester.\nHer white figure, trim and dashing; her round blue eyes, filled with coy\nwonder, the arch innocence of a spoiled child; her pale, smooth cheeks,\nrather plump, but coming oddly and enticingly to a point at the mouth\nand tilted chin; her lips, somewhat too full, too red, but quick and\nwhimsical: he saw these all, and these only, in a bright focus,\nlistening meanwhile to a voice by turns languid and lively, with now and\nthen a curious liquid softness, perhaps insincere, yet dangerously\npleasant. Questioning, hinting, she played at motherly age and wisdom.\nAs for him, he never before knew how well he could talk, or how\nengrossing his sober life, both in his native village on the Baltic and\nafterward in Bremen, could prove to either himself or a stranger.\n\nYet he was not such a fool, he reflected, as to tell everything. So far\nfrom trading confidences, she had told him only that she was bound\nstraight on to Hongkong; that curiosity alone had led her to travel\nsecond-class, \"for the delightful change, you know, from all such\nformality\"; and that she was \"really more French than English.\" Her\nreticence had the charm of an incognito; and taking this leaf from her\nbook, he gave himself out as a large, vaguely important person\njourneying on a large, vague errand.\n\n\"But you are a griffin?\" she had said, as they sat together at tea.\n\n\"Pardon?\" he ventured, wary and alarmed, wondering whether he could\nclaim this unknown term as in character with his part.\n\n\"I mean,\" Miss Forrester explained, smiling, \"it is your first visit to\nthe Far East?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" he replied eagerly, blushing. He would have given worlds to\nsay, \"No.\"\n\n\"Griffins are such nice little monsters,\" she purred. \"I like them.\"\n\nSometimes at night, waked by the snores of a fat Prussian in the upper\nberth, he lay staring into the dark, while the ship throbbed in unison\nwith his excited thoughts. He was amazed at his happy recklessness. He\nwould never see her again; he was hurrying toward lonely and uncertain\nshores; yet this brief voyage outvalued the rest of his life.\n\nIn time, they had left Penang,--another unheeded background for her\narch, innocent, appealing face,--and forged down the Strait of Malacca\nin a flood of nebulous moonlight. It was the last night out from\nSingapore. That veiled brightness, as they leaned on the rail, showed\nher brown hair fluttering dimly, her face pale, half real, half magical,\nher eyes dark and undefined pools of mystery. It was late; they had been\nsilent for a long time; and Rudolph felt that something beyond the\nterritory of words remained to be said, and that the one brilliant epoch\nof his life now drew madly to a close.\n\n\"What do you think of it all?\" the woman asked suddenly, gravely, as\nthough they had been isolated together in the deep spaces of the\nsame thought.\n\n\"I do not yet--Of what?\" rejoined Rudolph, at a loss.\n\n\"Of all this.\" She waved an eloquent little gesture toward the\nazure-lighted gulf.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Of the world?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered slowly. \"The world. Life.\" Her tone, subdued and\nmusical, conveyed in the mere words their full enigma and full meaning.\n\"All this that we see.\"\n\n\"Who can tell?\" He took her seriously, and ransacked all his store of\nsecond-hand philosophy for a worthy answer,--a musty store, dead and\npedantic, after the thrilling spirit of her words. \"Why, I think--it\nis--is it not all now the sense-manifest substance of our duty? Pardon.\nI am obscure. '_Das versinnlichte Material unserer Pflicht_' No?\"\n\nHer clear laughter startled him.\n\n\"Oh, how moral!\" she cried. \"What a highly moral little griffin!\"\n\nShe laughed again (but this time it was like the splash of water in a\ndeep well), and turned toward him that curiously tilted point of chin\nand mouth, her eyes shadowy and mocking. She looked young again,--the\nspirit of youth, of knowledge, of wonderful brightness and unbelief.\n\n\"Must we take it so very, very hard?\" she coaxed. \"Isn't it just a place\nto be happy in?\"\n\nAs through a tumult he heard, and recognized the wisdom of the ages.\n\n\"Because,\" she added, \"it lasts such a little while--\"\n\nOn the rail their hands suddenly touched. He was aware of nothing but\nthe nearness and pallor of her face, the darkness of her eyes shining up\nat him. All his life seemed to have rushed concentrating into that one\ninstant of extreme trouble, happiness, trembling fascination.\n\nFootsteps sounded on the deck behind them; an unwelcome voice called\njocosely:--\n\n\"Good efening!\" The ship's doctor advanced with a roguish, paternal air.\n\"You see at the phosphor, not?\"\n\nEven as she whipped about toward the light, Rudolph had seen, with a\ntouch of wonder, how her face changed from a bitter frown to the most\nfriendly smile. The frown returned, became almost savage, when the fat\nphysician continued:--\n\n\"To see the phosphor is too much moon, Mrs. Forrester?\"\n\nHad the steamer crashed upon a reef, he would hardly have noticed such a\nminor shipwreck. Mrs. Forrester? why, then--When the doctor, after\nponderous pleasantries, had waddled away aft, Rudolph turned upon her a\nface of tragedy.\n\n\"Was that true?\" he demanded grimly.\n\n\"Was what true?\" she asked, with baby eyes of wonder, which no longer\ndeceived, but angered.\n\n\"What the doctor said.\" Rudolph's voice trembled. \"The tittle--the title\nhe gave you.\"\n\n\"Why, of course,\" she laughed.\n\n\"And you did not tell me!\" he began, with scorn.\n\n\"Don't be foolish,\" she cut in. From beneath her skirt the toe of a\nsmall white shoe tapped the deck angrily. Of a sudden she laughed, and\nraised a tantalizing face, merry, candid, and inscrutable. \"Why, you\nnever asked me, and--and of course I thought you were saying it all\nalong. You have such a dear, funny way of pronouncing, you know.\"\n\nHe hesitated, almost believing; then, with a desperate gesture, wheeled\nand marched resolutely aft. That night it was no Prussian snores which\nkept him awake and wretched. \"Everything is finished,\" he thought\nabysmally. He lay overthrown, aching, crushed, as though pinned under\nthe fallen walls of his youth.\n\nAt breakfast-time, the ship lay still beside a quay where mad crowds of\nbrown and yellow men, scarfed, swathed, and turbaned in riotous colors,\nworked quarreling with harsh cries, in unspeakable interweaving uproar.\nThe air, hot and steamy, smelled of strange earth. As Rudolph followed a\nMalay porter toward the gang-plank, he was painfully aware that Mrs.\nForrester had turned from the rail and stood waiting in his path.\n\n\"Without saying good-by?\" she reproached him. The injured wonder in her\neyes he thought a little overdone.\n\n\"Good-by.\" He could not halt, but, raising his cap stiffly, managed to\nadd, \"A pleasant voyage,\" and passed on, feeling as though she had\nmurdered something.\n\nHe found himself jogging in a rickshaw, while equatorial rain beat like\ndown-pouring bullets on the tarpaulin hood, and sluiced the Chinaman's\noily yellow back. Over the heavy-muscled shoulders he caught glimpses of\nsullen green foliage, ponderous and drooping; of half-naked barbarians\nthat squatted in the shallow caverns of shops; innumerable faces, black,\nyellow, white, and brown, whirling past, beneath other tarpaulin hoods,\nor at carriage windows, or shielded by enormous dripping wicker hats, or\nbared to the pelting rain. Curious odors greeted him, as of sour\nvegetables and of unknown rank substances burning. He stared like a\nvisionary at the streaming multitude of alien shapes.\n\nThe coolie swerved, stopped, tilted his shafts to the ground. Rudolph\nentered a sombre, mouldy office, where the darkness rang with tiny\nsilver bells. Pig-tailed men in skull-caps, their faces calm as polished\nivory, were counting dollars endlessly over flying finger-tips. One of\nthese men paused long enough to give him a sealed dispatch,--the message\nto which the ocean-bed, the Midgard ooze, had thrilled beneath his\ntardy keel.\n\n\"Zimmerman recalled,\" the interpretation ran; \"take his station; proceed\nat once.\"\n\nHe knew the port only as forlorn and insignificant. It did not matter.\nOne consolation remained: he would never see her again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nTHE PIED PIPER\n\nA gray smudge trailing northward showed where the Fa-Hien--Scottish\nOriental, sixteen hundred tons--was disappearing from the pale expanse\nof ocean. The sampan drifted landward imperceptibly, seeming, with\nnut-brown sail unstirred, to remain where the impatient steamer had met\nit, dropped a solitary passenger overside, and cast him loose upon the\nbreadth of the antipodes. Rare and far, the sails of junks patched the\nhorizon with umber polygons. Rudolph, sitting among his boxes in the\nsampan, viewed by turns this desolate void astern and the more desolate\nsweep of coast ahead. His matting sail divided the shining bronze\noutpour of an invisible river, divided a low brown shore beyond, and\nabove these, the strips of some higher desert country that shone like\nsnowdrifts, or like sifted ashes from which the hills rose black and\ncharred. Their savage, winter-blasted look, in the clear light of an\nalmost vernal morning, made the land seem fabulous. Yet here in reality,\nthought Rudolph, as he floated toward that hoary kingdom,--here at last,\nfacing a lonely sea, reared the lifeless, inhospitable shore, the\nsullen margin of China.\n\nThe slow creaking of the spliced oar, swung in its lashing by a\nhalf-naked yellow man, his incomprehensible chatter with some fellow\nboatman hidden in the bows, were sounds lost in a drowsy silence,\nrhythms lost in a wide inertia. Time itself seemed stationary. Rudolph\nnodded, slept, and waking, found the afternoon sped, the hills gone, and\nhis clumsy, time-worn craft stealing close under a muddy bank topped\nwith brown weeds and grass. They had left behind the silted roadstead,\nand now, gliding on a gentle flood, entered the river-mouth. Here and\nthere, against the saffron tide, or under banks quaggy as melting\nchocolate, stooped a naked fisherman, who--swarthy as his background but\nfor a loin-band of yellow flesh--shone wet and glistening while he\nstirred a dip-net through the liquid mud. Faint in the distance harsh\ncries sounded now and then, and the soft popping of small-arms,--tiny\nrevolts in the reign of a stillness aged and formidable. Crumbling walls\nand squat ruins, black and green-patched with mould--old towers of\ndefense against pirates--guarded from either bank the turns of the\nriver. In one reach, a \"war-junk,\" her sails furled, lay at anchor, the\nred and white eyes staring fish-like from her black prow: a silly\nmonster, the painted tompions of her wooden cannon aiming drunkenly\naskew, her crew's wash fluttering peacefully in a line of blue dungaree.\n\nBeyond the next turn, a fowling-piece cracked sharply, close at hand;\nsomething splashed, and the ruffled body of a snipe bobbed in the bronze\nflood alongside.\n\n\"Hang it!\" complained a voice, loudly. \"The beggar was too--Hallo! Oh, I\nsay, Gilly! Gilly, ahoy! Pick us up, there's a good chap! The bird\nfirst, will you, and then me.\"\n\nA tall young man in brown holland and a battered _terai_ stood above on\nthe grassy brink.\n\n\"Oh, beg pardon,\" he continued. \"Took you for old Gilly, you know.\" He\nsnapped the empty shells from his gun, and blew into the breech, before\nadding, \"Would _you_ mind, then? That is, if you're bound up for\nStink-Chau. It's a beastly long tramp, and I've been shooting all\nafternoon.\"\n\nFollowed by three coolies who popped out of the grass with game-bags,\nthe young stranger descended, hopped nimbly from tussock to gunwale, and\nperched there to wash his boots in the river.\n\n\"Might have known you weren't old Gilly,\" he said over his shoulder.\n\"Wutzler said the Fa-Hien lay off signaling for sampan before breakfast.\nGoing to stay long?\"\n\n\"I am agent,\" answered Rudolph, with a touch of pride, \"for Fliegelman\nand Sons.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" drawled the hunter, lazily. He swung his legs inboard, faced\nabout, and studied Rudolph with embarrassing frankness. He was a\nlong-limbed young Englishman, whose cynical gray eyes, and thin face\ntinged rather sallow and Oriental, bespoke a reckless good humor. \"Life\nsentence, eh? Then your name's--what is it again?--Hackh, isn't it?\nHeywood's mine. So you take Zimmerman's place. He's off already, and\ngood riddance. He _was_ a bounder!--Charming spot you've come to! I\ndaresay if your Fliegelmans opened a hong in hell, you might possibly\nget a worse station.\"\n\nWithout change of manner, he uttered a few gabbling, barbaric words. A\ncoolie knelt, and with a rag began to clean the boots, which, from the\nexpression of young Mr. Heywood's face, were more interesting than the\narrival of a new manager from Germany.\n\n\"It will be dark before we're in,\" he said. \"My place for the night, of\ncourse, and let your predecessor's leavings stand over till daylight.\nAfter dinner we'll go to the club. Dinner! Chicken and rice, chicken and\nrice! Better like it, though, for you'll eat nothing else, term of\nyour life.\"\n\n\"You are very kind,\" began Rudolph; but this bewildering off-hand\nyoungster cut him short, with a laugh:--\n\n\"No fear, you'll pay me! Your firm supplies unlimited liquor. Much good\nthat ever did us, with old Zimmerman.\"\n\nThe sampan now slipped rapidly on the full flood, up a narrow channel\nthat the setting of the sun had turned, as at a blow, from copper to\nindigo. The shores passed, more and more obscure against a fading light.\nA star or two already shone faint in the lower spaces. A second war-junk\nloomed above them, with a ruddy fire in the stern lighting a glimpse of\nsquat forms and yellow goblin faces.\n\n\"It is very curious,\" said Rudolph, trying polite conversation, \"how\nthey paint so the eyes on their jonks.\"\n\n\"No eyes, no can see; no can see, no can walkee,\" chanted Heywood in\ncareless formula. \"I say,\" he complained suddenly, \"you're not going to\n'study the people,' and all that rot? We're already fed up with\nmissionaries. Their cant, I mean; no allusion to cannibalism.\"\n\nHe lighted a cigarette. After the blinding flare of the match, night\nseemed to have fallen instantaneously. As their boat crept on to the\nslow creaking sweep, both maintained silence, Rudolph rebuked and\nlonely, Heywood supine beneath a comfortable winking spark.\n\n\"What I mean is,\" drawled the hunter, \"we need all the good fellows we\ncan get. Bring any new songs out? Oh, I forgot, you're a German, too.--A\nsweet little colony! Gilly's the only gentleman in the whole half-dozen\nof us, and Heaven knows he's not up to much.--Ah, we're in. On our\nright, fellow sufferers, we see the blooming Village of Stinks.\"\n\nHe had risen in the gloom. Beyond his shadow a few feeble lights burned\nlow and scattered along the bank. Strange cries arose, the bumping of\nsampans, the mournful caterwauling of a stringed instrument.\n\n\"The native town's a bit above,\" he continued. \"We herd together here on\nthe edge. No concession, no bund, nothing.\"\n\nTheir sampan grounded softly in malodorous ooze. Each mounting the bare\nshoulders of a coolie, the two Europeans rode precariously to shore.\n\n\"My boys will fetch your boxes,\" called Heywood. \"Come on.\"\n\nThe path, sometimes marshy, sometimes hard-packed clay or stone flags\ndeeply littered, led them a winding course in the night. Now and then\nshapes met them and pattered past in single file, furtive and sinister.\nAt last, where a wall loomed white, Heywood stopped, and, kicking at a\nwooden gate, gave a sing-song cry. With rattling weights, the door\nswung open, and closed behind them heavily. A kind of empty garden, a\nbare little inclosure, shone dimly in the light that streamed from a\nlow, thick-set veranda at the farther end. Dogs flew at them, barking\noutrageously.\n\n\"Down, Chang! Down, Chutney!\" cried their master. \"Be quiet, Flounce,\nyou fool!\"\n\nOn the stone floor of the house, they leaped upon him, two red chows and\na fox-terrier bitch, knocking each other over in their joy.\n\n\"Olo she-dog he catchee plenty lats,\" piped a little Chinaman, who\nshuffled out from a side-room where lamplight showed an office desk.\n\"Too-day catchee. Plenty lats. No can.\"\n\n\"My compradore, Ah Pat,\" said Heywood to Rudolph. \"Ah Pat, my friend he\nb'long number one Flickleman, boss man.\"\n\nThe withered little creature bobbed in his blue robe, grinning at the\nintroduction.\n\n\"You welly high-tone man,\" he murmured amiably. \"Catchee goo' plice.\"\n\n\"All the same, I don't half like it,\" was Heywood's comment later. He\nhad led his guest upstairs into a bare white-washed room, furnished in\nwicker. Open windows admitted the damp sea breeze and a smell, like foul\ngun-barrels, from the river marshes. \"Where should all the rats be\ncoming from?\" He frowned, meditating on what Rudolph thought a trifle.\nAbove the sallow brown face, his chestnut hair shone oddly,\nclose-cropped and vigorous. \"Maskee, can't be helped.--O Boy, one\nsherry-bitters, one bamboo!\"\n\n\"To our better acquaintance,\" said Rudolph, as they raised their\nglasses.\n\n\"What? Oh, yes, thanks,\" the other laughed. \"Any one would know you for\na griffin here, Mr. Hackh. You've not forgotten your manners yet.\"\n\nWhen they had sat down to dinner in another white-washed room, and had\nundertaken the promised rice and chicken, he laughed again,\nsomewhat bitterly.\n\n\"Better acquaintance--no fear! You'll be so well acquainted with us all\nthat you'll wish you never clapped eyes on us.\" He drained his whiskey\nand soda, signaled for more, and added: \"Were you ever cooped up,\nyachting, with a chap you detested? That's the feeling you come to\nhave.--Here, stand by. You're drinking nothing.\"\n\nRudolph protested. Politeness had so far conquered habit, that he felt\nuncommonly flushed, genial, and giddy.\n\n\"That,\" urged Heywood, tapping the bottle, \"that's our only amusement.\nYou'll see. One good thing we can get is the liquor. 'Nisi damnose\nbibimus,'--forget how it runs: 'Drink hearty, or you'll die without\ngetting your revenge,'\"\n\n\"You are then a university's-man?\" cried Rudolph, with enthusiasm.\n\nThe other nodded gloomily. On the instant his face had fallen as\nimpassive as that of the Chinese boy who stood behind his chair,\nstraight, rigid, like a waxen image of Gravity in a blue gown.--\"Yes, of\nsorts. Young fool. Scrapes. Debt. Out to Orient. Same old story. More\ndebt. Trust the firm to encourage that! Debt and debt and debt. Tied up\nsafe. Transfer. Finish! Never go Home.\"--He rose with a laugh and an\nimpatient gesture.--\"Come on. Might as well take in the club as to sit\nhere talking rot.\"\n\nOutside the gate of the compound, coolies crouching round a lantern\nsprang upright and whipped a pair of sedan-chairs into position.\nHeywood, his feet elevated comfortably over the poles, swung in the\nlead; Rudolph followed, bobbing in the springy rhythm of the long\nbamboos. The lanterns danced before them down an open road, past a few\nblank walls and dark buildings, and soon halted before a whitened front,\nwhere light gleamed from the upper story.\n\n\"Mind the stairs,\" called Heywood. \"Narrow and beastly dark.\"\n\nAs they stumbled up the steep flight, Rudolph heard the click of\nbilliard balls. A pair of hanging lamps lighted the room into which he\nrose,--a low, gloomy loft, devoid of comfort. At the nearer table, a\nweazened little man bent eagerly over a pictorial paper; at the farther,\nchalking their cues, stood two players, one a sturdy Englishman with a\ngray moustache, the other a lithe, graceful person, whose blue coat,\nsmart as an officer's, and swarthy but handsome face made him at a\nglance the most striking figure in the room. A little Chinese imp in\nwhite, who acted as marker, turned on the new-comers a face of\npreternatural cunning.\n\n\"Mr. Wutzler,\" said Heywood. The weazened reader rose in a nervous\nflutter, underwent his introduction to Rudolph with as much bashful\nagony as a school-girl, mumbled a few words in German, and instantly\ntook refuge in his tattered _Graphic_. The players, however, advanced in\na more friendly fashion. The Englishman, whose name Rudolph did not\ncatch, shook his hand heartily.\n\n\"Mr. Hackh is a welcome addition.\" He spoke with deliberate courtesy.\nSomething in his voice, the tired look in his frank blue eyes and\nserious face, at once engaged respect. \"For our sakes,\" he continued,\n\"we're glad to see you here. I am sure Doctor Chantel will agree\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed,\" said the man in military blue, with a courtier's bow.\nBoth air and accent were French. \"Most welcome.\"\n\n\"Let's all have a drink,\" cried Heywood. Despite his many glasses at\ndinner, he spoke with the alacrity of a new idea. \"O Boy, whiskey\n_Ho-lan suey, fai di_!\"\n\nAway bounded the boy marker like a tennis-ball.\n\n\"Hello, Wutzler's off already!\"--The little old reader had quietly\ndisappeared, leaving them a vacant table.--\"Isn't he weird?\" laughed\nHeywood, as they sat down. \"Comes and goes like a ghost.\"\n\n\"It is his Chinese wife,\" declared Chantel, preening his moustache. \"He\nis always ashame to meet the new persons.\"\n\n\"Poor old chap,\" said Heywood. \"I know--feels himself an outcast and all\nthat. Humph! With us! Quite unnecessary.\"--The Chinese page, quick,\nsolemn, and noiseless, glided round the table with his tray.--\"Ah, you\nyoung devil! You're another weird one, you atom. See those bead eyes\nwatching us, eh? A Gilpin Homer, you are, and some fine day we'll see\nyou go off in a flash of fire. If you don't poison us all first.--Well,\nhere's fortune!\"\n\n\"Your health, Mr. Hackh,\" amended the other Englishman.\n\nAs they set down their glasses, a strange cry sounded from below,--a\nstifled call, inarticulate, but in such a key of distress that all four\nfaced about, and listened intently.\n\n\"Kom down,\" called a hesitating voice, \"kom down and look-see.\"\n\nThey sprang to the stairs, and clattered downward. Dim radiance flooded\nthe landing, from the street door. Outside, a smoky lantern on the\nground revealed the lower levels.\n\nIn the wide sector of light stood Wutzler, shrinking and apologetic,\nlike a man caught in a fault, his wrinkled face eloquent of fear, his\ngesture eloquent of excuse. Round him, as round a conjurer, scores of\nlittle shadowy things moved in a huddling dance, fitfully hopping like\nsparrows over spilt grain. Where the light fell brightest these became\nplainer, their eyes shone in jeweled points of color.\n\n\"By Jove, Gilly, they are rats!\" said Heywood, in a voice curiously\nforced and matter-of-fact. \"Flounce killed several this afternoon,\nso my--\"\n\nNo one heeded him; all stared. The rats, like beings of incantation,\nstole about with an absence of fear, a disregard of man's presence, that\nwas odious and alarming.\n\n\"Earthquake?\" The elder Englishman spoke as though afraid of disturbing\nsome one.\n\nThe French doctor shook his head.\n\n\"No,\" he answered in the same tone. \"Look.\"\n\nThe rats, in all their weaving confusion, displayed one common impulse.\nThey sprang upward continually, with short, agonized leaps, like\ndrowning creatures struggling to keep afloat above some invisible flood.\nThe action, repeated multitudinously into the obscure background,\nexaggerated in the foreground by magnified shadows tossing and falling\non the white walls, suggested the influence of some evil stratum, some\nvapor subtle and diabolic, crawling poisonously along the ground.\n\nHeywood stamped angrily, without effect. Wutzler stood abject, a\nmagician impotent against his swarm of familiars. Gradually the rats,\nsilent and leaping, passed away into the darkness, as though they heard\nthe summons of a Pied Piper.\n\n\"It doesn't attack Europeans.\" Heywood still used that curious\ninflection.\n\n\"Then my brother Julien is still alive,\" retorted Doctor Chantel,\nbitterly.\n\n\"What do you think, Gilly?\" persisted Heywood.\n\nHis compatriot nodded in a meaningless way.\n\n\"The doctor's right, of course,\" he answered. \"I wish my wife weren't\ncoming back.\"\n\n\"Dey are a remember,\" ventured Wutzler, timidly. \"A warnung.\"\n\nThe others, as though it had been a point of custom, ignored him. All\nstared down, musing, at the vacant stones.\n\n\"Then the concert's off to-morrow night,\" mocked Heywood, with an\nunpleasant laugh.\n\n\"On the contrary.\" Gilly caught him up, prompt and decided. \"We shall\nneed all possible amusements; also to meet and plan our campaign.\nMeantime,--what do you say, Doctor?--chloride of lime in pots?\"\n\n\"That, evidently,\" smiled the handsome man. \"Yes, and charcoal burnt in\nbraziers, perhaps, as Pere Fenouil advises. Fumigate.\"--Satirical and\ndebonair, he shrugged his shoulders.--\"What use, among these thousands\nof yellow pigs?\"\n\n\"I wish she weren't coming,\" repeated Gilly.\n\nRudolph, left outside this conference, could bear the uncertainty no\nlonger.\n\n\"I am a new arrival,\" he confided to his young host. \"I do not\nunderstand. What is it?\"\n\n\"The plague, old chap,\" replied Heywood, curtly. \"These playful little\nanimals get first notice. You're not the only arrival to-night.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nUNDER FIRE\n\nThe desert was sometimes Gobi, sometimes Sahara, but always an infinite\nstretch of sand that floated up and up in a stifling layer, like the\ntide. Rudolph, desperately choked, continued leaping upward against an\ninsufferable power of gravity, or straining to run against the force of\nparalysis. The desert rang with phantom voices,--Chinese voices that\nmocked him, chanting of pestilence, intoning abhorrently in French.\n\nHe woke to find a knot of bed-clothes smothering him. To his first\nunspeakable relief succeeded the astonishment of hearing the voices\ncontinue in shrill chorus, the tones Chinese, the words, in louder\nfragments, unmistakably French. They sounded close at hand, discordant\nmatins sung by a mob of angry children. Once or twice a weary, fretful\nvoice scolded feebly: \"Un-peu-de-s'lence! Un-peu-de-s'lence!\" Rudolph\nrose to peep through the heavy jalousies, but saw nothing more than\nsullen daylight, a flood of vertical rain, and thin rivulets coursing\ndown a tiled roof below. The morning was dismally cold.\n\n\"Jolivet's kids wake you?\" Heywood, in a blue kimono, nodded from the\ndoorway. \"Public nuisance, that school. Quite needless, too. Some bally\nFrench theory, you know, sphere of influence, and that rot. Game played\nout up here, long ago, but they keep hanging on.--Bath's ready, when you\nlike.\" He broke out laughing. \"Did you climb into the water-jar,\nyesterday, before dinner? Boy reports it upset. You'll find the dipper\nmore handy.--How did you ever manage? One leg at a time?\"\n\nEchoes of glee followed his disappearance. Rudolph, blushing, prepared\nto descend into the gloomy vault of ablution. Charcoal fumes, however,\nand the glow of a brazier on the dark floor below, not only revived all\nhis old terror, but at the stair-head halted him with a new.\n\n\"Is the water safe?\" he called.\n\nHeywood answered impatiently from his bedroom.\n\n\"Nothing safe in this world, Mr. Hackh. User's risk.\" An inaudible\nmutter ended with, \"Keep clean, anyway.\"\n\nAt breakfast, though the acrid smoke was an enveloping reminder, he made\nthe only reference to their situation.\n\n\"Rain at last: too late, though, to flush out the gutters. We needed it\na month ago.--I say, Hackh, if you don't mind, you might as well cheer\nup. From now on, it's pure heads and tails. We're all under fire\ntogether.\" Glancing out of window at the murky sky, he added\nthoughtfully, \"One excellent side to living without hope, maskee\nfashion: one isn't specially afraid. I'll take you to your office, and\nyou can make a start. Nothing else to do, is there?\"\n\nDripping bearers and shrouded chairs received them on the lower floor,\ncarried them out into a chill rain that drummed overhead and splashed\nalong the compound path in silver points. The sunken flags in the road\nformed a narrow aqueduct that wavered down a lane of mire. A few\ngrotesque wretches, thatched about with bamboo matting, like bottles, or\nlike rosebushes in winter, trotted past shouldering twin baskets. The\nsmell of joss-sticks, fish, and sour betel, the subtle sweetness of\nopium, grew constantly stronger, blended with exhalations of ancient\nrefuse, and (as the chairs jogged past the club, past filthy groups\nhuddling about the well in a marketplace, and onward into the black yawn\nof the city gate) assailed the throat like a bad and lasting taste. Now,\nin the dusky street, pent narrowly by wet stone walls, night seemed to\nfall, while fresh waves of pungent odor overwhelmed and steeped the\nsenses. Rudolph's chair jostled through hundreds and hundreds of\nChinese, all alike in the darkness, who shuffled along before with\nswitching queues, or flattened against the wall to stare, almost nose\nto nose, at the passing foreigner. With chairpoles backing into one shop\nor running ahead into another, with raucous cries from the coolies, he\nswung round countless corners, bewildered in a dark, leprous, nightmare\nbazaar. Overhead, a slit of cloudy sky showed rarely; for the most part,\nhe swayed along indoors, beneath a dingy lattice roof. All points of the\ncompass vanished; all streets remained alike,--the same endless vista of\nmystic characters, red, black, and gold, on narrow suspended tablets,\nunder which flowed the same current of pig-tailed men in blue and dirty\nwhite. From every shop, the same yellow faces stared at him, the same\nelfin children caught his eye for a half-second to grin or grimace, the\nsame shaven foreheads bent over microscopical tasks in the dark. At\nfirst, Rudolph thought the city loud and brawling; but resolving this\nimpression to the hideous shouts of his coolies parting the crowd, he\ndetected, below or through their noise, from all the long\ncross-corridors a wide and appalling silence. Gradually, too, small\nsounds relieved this: the hammering of brass-work, the steady rattle of\na loom, or the sing-song call and mellow bell of some burdened hawker,\nbumping past, his swinging baskets filled with a pennyworth of trifles.\nBut still the silence daunted Rudolph in this astounding vision, this\nmasque of unreal life, of lost daylight, of annihilated direction, of\nplacid turmoil and multifarious identity, made credible only by the\npermanence of nauseous smells.\n\nSomewhere in the dark maze, the chairs halted, under a portal black and\nheavy as a Gate of Dreams. And as by the anachronism of dreams\nthere hung, among its tortuous symbols, the small, familiar\nplacard--\"Fliegelman and Sons, Office.\" Heywood led the way, past two\nducking Chinese clerks, into a sombre room, stone-floored, furnished\nstiffly with a row of carved chairs against the wall, lighted coldly by\nroof-windows of placuna, and a lamp smoking before some commercial god\nin his ebony and tinsel shrine.\n\n\"There,\" he said, bringing Rudolph to an inner chamber, or dark little\npent-house, where another draughty lamp flickered on a European desk.\n\"Here's your cell. I'm off--call for you later. Good luck!\"--Wheeling in\nthe doorway, he tossed a book, negligently.--\"Caught! You may as well\nstart in, eh?--'Cantonese Made Worse,'\"\n\nTo his departing steps Rudolph listened as a prisoner, condemned, might\nlisten to the last of all earthly visitors. Peering through a kind of\nbutler's window, he saw beyond the shrine his two pallid subordinates,\nlike mystic automatons, nodding and smoking by the doorway. Beyond\nthem, across a darker square like a cavern-mouth, flitted the living\nphantoms of the street. It seemed a fit setting for his fears. \"I am\nlost,\" he thought; lost among goblins, marooned in the age of barbarism,\nshut in a labyrinth with a Black Death at once actual and mediaeval: he\ndared not think of Home, but flung his arms on the littered desk, and\nburied his face.\n\nOn the tin pent-roof, the rain trampled inexorably.\n\nAt last, mustering a shaky resolution, he set to work ransacking the\ntumbled papers. Happily, Zimmerman had left all in confusion. The very\nhopelessness of his accounts proved a relief. Working at high tension,\nRudolph wrestled through disorder, mistakes, falsification; and little\nby little, as the sorted piles grew and his pen traveled faster, the old\nabsorbing love of method and dispatch--the stay, the cordial flagon of\ntroubled man--gave him strength to forget.\n\nAt times, felt shoes scuffed the stone floor without, and high, scolding\nvoices rose, exchanging unfathomable courtesy with his clerks. One after\nanother, strange figures, plump and portly in their  robes,\ncrossed his threshold, nodding their buttoned caps, clasping their hands\nhidden in voluminous sleeves.\n\n\"My 'long speakee my goo' flien',\" chanted each of these apparitions;\nand each, after a long, slow discourse that ended more darkly than it\nbegan, retired with fatuous nods and smirks of satisfaction, leaving\nRudolph dismayed by a sense of cryptic negotiation in which he had been\nfound wanting.\n\nNoon brought the only other interval, when two solemn \"boys\" stole in\nwith curry and beer. Eat he could not in this lazaret, but sipped a\nlittle of the dark Kirin brew, and plunged again into his researches.\nAlone with his lamp and rustling papers, he fought through perplexities,\nnow whispering, now silent, like a student rapt in some midnight fervor.\n\n\"What ho! Mustn't work this fashion!\" Heywood's voice woke him, sudden\nas a gust of sharp air. \"Makee finish!\"\n\nThe summons was both welcome and unwelcome; for as their chairs jostled\nhomeward through the reeking twilight, Rudolph felt the glow of work\nfade like the mockery of wine. The strange seizure returned,--exile,\ndanger, incomprehensibility, settled down upon him, cold and steady as\nthe rain. Tea, at Heywood's house, was followed by tobacco, tobacco by\nsherry, and this by a dinner from yesterday's game-bag. The two men said\nlittle, sitting dejected, as if by agreement. But when Heywood rose, he\nchanged into gayety as a man slips on a jacket.\n\n\"Now, then, for the masked ball! I mean, we can't carry these long\nfaces to the club, can we? Ladies' Night--what larks!\" He caught up his\ncap, with a grimace. \"The Lord loveth a cheerful liar. Come ahead!\"\n\nOn the way, he craned from his chair to shout, in the darkness:--\n\n\"I say! If you can do a turn of any sort, let the women have it. All the\nfun they get. Be an ass, like the rest of us. Maskee how silly! Mind\nyou, it's all hands, these concerts!\"\n\nNo music, but the click of ivory and murmur of voices came down the\nstairway of the club. At first glance, as Rudolph rose above the floor,\nthe gloomy white loft seemed vacant as ever; at second glance,\nembarrassingly full of Europeans. Four strangers grounded their cues\nlong enough to shake his hand. \"Mr. Nesbit,--Sturgeon--Herr\nKempner--Herr Teppich,\"--he bowed stiffly to each, ran the battery of\ntheir inspection, and found himself saluting three other persons at the\nend of the room, under a rosy, moon-bellied lantern. A gray matron,\nstout, and too tightly dressed for comfort, received him uneasily, a\ndark-eyed girl befriended him with a look and a quiet word, while a tall\nman, nodding a vigorous mop of silver hair, crushed his hand in a great\nbony fist.\n\n\"Mrs. Earle,\" Heywood was saying, \"Miss Drake, and--how are you,\npadre?--Dr. Earle.\"\n\n\"Good-evening,\" boomed the giant, in a deep and musical bass. \"We are\nvery glad, very glad.\" His voice vibrated through the room, without\neffort. It struck one with singular force, like the shrewd, kind\nbrightness of his eyes, light blue, and oddly benevolent, under brows\nhard as granite. \"Sit down, Mr. Hackh,\" he ordered genially, \"and give\nus news of the other world! I mean,\" he laughed, \"west of Suez.\nSmoking's allowed--here, try that!\"\n\nHe commanded them, as it were, to take their ease,--the women among\ncushions on a rattan couch, the men stretched in long chairs. He put\nquestions, indolent, friendly questions, opening vistas of reply and\nrecollection; so that Rudolph, answering, felt the first return of\nhomely comfort. A feeble return, however, and brief: in the pauses of\ntalk, misgiving swarmed in his mind, like the leaping vermin of last\nnight. The world into which he had been thrown still appeared\ndisorderly, incomprehensible, and dangerous. The plague--it still\nrecurred in his thoughts like a sombre motive; these friendly people\nwere still strangers; and for a moment now and then their talk, their\nsmiles, the click of billiards, the cool, commonplace behavior, seemed a\nfoolhardy unconcern, as of men smoking in a powder magazine.\n\n\"Clearing a bit, outside,\" called Nesbit. A little, wiry fellow, with\ncheerful Cockney speech, he stood chalking his cue at a window. \"I say,\nwhat's the matter one piecee picnic this week? Pink Pagoda, eh? Mrs.\nGilly's back, you know.\"\n\n\"No, is she?\" wheezed the fat Sturgeon, with something like enthusiasm.\n\"Now we'll brighten up! By Jove, that's good news. That's worth hearing.\nEh, Heywood?\"\n\n\"Rather!\" drawled Rudolph's friend, with an alacrity that seemed half\ncynical, half enigmatic.\n\nA quick tread mounted the stairs, and into the room rose Dr. Chantel. He\nbowed gracefully to the padre's group, but halted beside the players.\nWhatever he said, they forgot their game, and circled the table to\nlisten. He spoke earnestly, his hands fluttering in nervous gestures.\n\n\"Something's up,\" grumbled Heywood, \"when the doctor forgets to pose.\"\n\nBehind Chantel, as he wheeled, heaved the gray bullet-head and sturdy\nshoulders of Gilly.\n\n\"Alone?\" called the padre. \"Why, where's the Mem?\"\n\nHe came up with evident weariness, but replied cheerfully:--\n\n\"She's very sorry, and sent chin-chins all round. But to-night--Her\njourney, you know. She's resting.--I hope we've not delayed\nthe concert?\"\n\n\"Last man starts it!\" Heywood sprang up, flung open a battered piano,\nand dragged Chantel to the stool. \"Come, Gilly, your forfeit!\"\n\nThe elder man blushed, and coughed.\n\n\"Why, really,\" he stammered. \"Really, if you wish me to!\"\n\nHeywood slid back into his chair, grinning.\n\n\"Proud as an old peacock,\" he whispered to Rudolph. \"Peacock's voice,\ntoo.\"\n\nDr. Chantel struck a few jangling chords, and skipping adroitly over\nsick notes, ran a flourish. The billiard-players joined the circle, with\nabsent, serious faces. The singer cleared his throat, took on a\npreternatural solemnity, and began. In a dismal, gruff voice, he\nproclaimed himself a miner, deep, deep down:--\n\n\n\"And few, I trow, of my being know,\nAnd few that an atom care!\"\n\n\nHis hearers applauded this gloomy sentiment, till his cheeks flushed\nagain with honest satisfaction. But in the full sweep of a brilliant\ninterlude, Chantel suddenly broke down.\n\n\"I cannot,\" he declared sharply. As he turned on the squealing stool,\nthey saw his face white and strangely wrought. \"I had meant,\" he said,\nwith painful precision, \"to say nothing to-night, and act as--I cannot.\nJudge you, what I feel.\"\n\nHe got uncertainly to his feet, hesitating.\n\n\"Ladies, you will not be alarmed.\" The four players caught his eye, and\nnodded. \"It is well that you know. There is no danger here, more than--I\nam since disinfected. Monsieur Jolivet, my compatriot--You see, you\nunderstand. Yes, the plague.\"\n\nFor a space, the distant hum of the streets invaded the room. Then\nHeywood's book of music slapped the floor like a pistol-shot.\n\n\"You left him!\" He bounced from his chair, raging. \"You--Peng! Where's\nmy cap?\"\n\nQuick as he was, the dark-eyed girl stood blocking his way.\n\n\"Not you, Mr. Heywood,\" she said quietly. \"I must go stay with him.\"\n\nThey confronted each other, man and woman, as if for a combat of will.\nThe outbreak of voices was cut short; the whole company stood, like\nHomeric armies, watching two champions. Chantel, however, broke\nthe silence.\n\n\"Nobody must go.\" He eyed them all, gravely. \"I left him, yes. He does\nnot need any one. Personne. Very sudden. He went to the school sick this\nmorning. Swollen axillae--the poor fool, not to know!--et\npuis--enfin--He is dead.\"\n\nHeywood pitched his cap on the green field of the billiard-cloth.\n\n\"The poor pedagogue!\" he said bitterly. \"_He_ was going Home.\"\n\nSudden, hot and cold, like the thrust of a knife, it struck Rudolph that\nhe had heard the voice of this first victim,--the peevish voice which\ncried so weakly for a little silence, at early daylight, that very\nmorning. A little silence: and he had received the great.\n\nA gecko fell from the ceiling, with a tiny thump that made all start. He\nhad struck the piano, and the strings answered with a faint, aeolian\nconfusion. Then, as they regarded one another silently, a rustle, a\nflurry, sounded on the stairs. A woman stumbled into the loft, sobbing,\ncrying something inarticulate, as she ran blindly toward them, with\nwhite face and wild eyes. She halted abruptly, swayed as though to fall,\nand turned, rather by instinct than by vision, to the other women.\n\n\"Bertha!\" protested Gilly, with a helpless stare. \"My dear!\"\n\n\"I couldn't stay!\" she cried. \"The amah told me. Why did you ever let me\ncome back? Oh, do something--help me!\"\n\nThe face and the voice came to Rudolph like another trouble across a\ndream. He knew them, with a pang. This trembling, miserable heap, flung\ninto the arms of the dark-eyed girl, was Mrs. Forrester.\n\n\"Go on,\" said the girl, calmly. She had drawn the woman down beside her\non the rattan couch, and clasping her like a child, nodded toward the\npiano. \"Go on, as if the doctor hadn't--hadn't stopped.\"\n\nHeywood was first to obey.\n\n\"Come, Chantel, chantez! Here's your song.\" He took the stool in\nleap-frog fashion, and struck a droll simultaneous discord. \"Come on.--\nWell, then, catch me on the chorus!\"\n\n\n\"Pour qu' j' finisse\nMon service\nAu Tonkin je suis parti!\"\n\n\nTo a discreet set of verses, he rattled a bravado accompaniment.\nPresently Chantel moved to his side, and, with the same spirit, swung\ninto the chorus. The tumbled white figure on the couch clung to her\nrefuge, her bright hair shining below the girl's quiet, thoughtful face.\nShe was shaken with convulsive regularity.\n\nIn his riot of emotions, Rudolph found an over-mastering shame. A\npicture returned,--the Strait of Malacca, this woman in the blue\nmoonlight, a Mistress of Life, rejoicing, alluring,--who was now the\nsingle coward in the room. But was she? The question was quick and\nrevolting. As quickly, a choice of sides was forced on him. He\nunderstood these people, recalled Heywood's saying, and with that, some\nstory of a regiment which lay waiting in the open, and sang while the\nbullets picked and chose. All together: as now these half-dozen men\nwere roaring cheerfully:--\n\n\n\"Ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkiki, ma Tonkinoise,\nYen a d'autr's qui m' font les doux yeux,\nMais c'est ell' que j'aim' le mieux!\"\n\n\nThe new recruit joined them, awkwardly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nTHE SWORD-PEN\n\n\"Wutzler was missing last night,\" said Heywood, lazily. He had finished\nbreakfast, and lighted a short, fat, glossy pipe. \"Just occurred to me.\nWe must have a look in on him. Poor old Wutz, he's getting worse and\nworse. Chantel's right, I fancy: it's the native wife.\" He rose, with a\nshort laugh. \"Queer. The rest never feel so,--Nesbit, and Sturgeon, and\nthat lot. But then, they don't fall so low as to marry theirs.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" he sneered, on the landing, \"until this scare blows over,\nyou'd better postpone any such establishment, if you intend--\"\n\n\"I do not,\" stammered Rudolph.\n\nTo his amazement, the other clapped him on the shoulder.\n\n\"I say!\" The sallow face and cynical gray eyes lighted, for the first\ntime, with something like enthusiasm. Next moment they had darkened\nagain, but not before he had said gruffly, \"You're not a bad\nlittle chap.\"\n\nMorosely, as if ashamed of this outburst, he led the way through the\nbare, sunny compound, and when the gate had closed rattling behind\nthem, stated their plans concisely and sourly. \"No work to-day, not a\nstroke! We'll just make it a holiday, catchee good time.--What? No. Rot!\nI won't work, and you can't. That's all there is about that. Don't be an\nass! Come along. We'll go out first and see Captain Kneebone.\" And when\nRudolph, faithful to certain tradesmen snoring in Bremen, would have\nprotested mildly, he let fly a stinging retort, and did not regain his\ntemper until they had passed the outskirts of the village. Yet even the\nquarrel seemed part of some better understanding, some new, subtle bond\nbetween two lonely men.\n\nBefore them opened a broad field dotted with curious white disks, like\nbone buttons thrown on a green carpet. Near at hand, coolies trotted and\nstooped, laying out more of these circular baskets, filled with tiny\ndough-balls. Makers of rice-wine, said Heywood; as he strode along\nexplaining, he threw off his surly fit. The brilliant sunlight, the\nbreeze stirring toward them from a background of drooping bamboos, the\ngabble of coolies, the faint aroma of the fermenting _no-me_ cakes,\nbegan, after all, to give a truant sense of holiday.\n\nAlmost gayly, the companions threaded a marshy path to the river, and\nbargained with a shrewd, plump woman who squatted in the bow of a\nsampan. She chaffered angrily, then laughed at some unknown saying of\nHeywood's, and let them come aboard. Summoned by voluble scolding, her\nhusband appeared, and placidly labored at the creaking sweep. They\nslipped down a river of bronze, between the oozy banks; and the\nwar-junks, the naked fisherman, the green-coated ruins of forts, drifted\npast like things in reverie, while the men lay smoking, basking in\nbright weather. They looked up into serene spaces, and forgot the umbra\nof pestilence.\n\nHeywood, now lazy, now animated, exchanged barbaric words with the\nboat-woman. As their tones rose and fell, she laughed. Long afterward,\nRudolph was to remember her, a wholesome, capable figure in faded blue,\ndarting keen glances from her beady eyes, flashing her white teeth in a\nsmile, or laughing till the green pendants of false jade trembled in\nher ears.\n\n\"Her name is Mrs. Wu,\" said Heywood, between smoke-rings, \"and she is a\nlady of humor. We are discussing the latest lawsuit, which she describes\nas suing a flea and winning the bite. Her maiden name was the Pretty\nLily. She is captain of this sampan, and fears that her husband does not\nrate A. B.\"\n\nWhere the river disembogued, the Pretty Lily, cursing and shrilling,\npattering barefoot about her craft, set a matting sail and caught the\nbreeze. Over the copper surface of the roadstead, the sampan drew out\nhandily. Ahead, a black, disreputable little steamer lay anchored, her\nname--two enormous hieroglyphics painted amidships--staring a bilious\nyellow in the morning sun. Under these, at last, the sampan came\nbumping, unperceived or neglected.\n\nOverhead, a pair of white shoes protruded from the rail in a blue film\nof smoke. They twitched, as a dry cackle of laughter broke out.\n\n\"Kut Sing, ahoy!\" shouted Heywood. \"On deck! Kneebone!\"\n\nThe shoes whipped inboard. Outboard popped a ruddy little face, set in\nthe green circle of a _topi_, and contorted with laughter.\n\n\"Listen to this, will ye!\" cried the apparition, as though illustrating\na point. Leaning his white sleeves on the rail, cigar in one fist,\nTauchnitz volume in the other, he roared down over the side a passage of\nprose, from which his visitors caught only the words \"Ginger Dick\" and\n\"Peter Russet,\" before mirth strangled him.\n\n\"God bless a man,\" he cried, choking, \"that can make a lonesome old\nbeggar laugh, out here! Eh, what? How he ever thinks up--But he's took\nto writing plays, they tell me. Plays!\" He scowled ferociously. \"Fat lot\no' good they are, for skippers, and planters, and gory exiles! Eh, what?\nBe-george, I'll write him a chit! _I'll_ tell him! Plays be damned; we\nwant more stories!\"\n\nRed and savage, he hurled the book fluttering into the sea, then swore\nin consternation.\n\n\"Oh, I say!\" he wailed. \"Fish her out! I've not finished her. My\nintention was, ye know, to fling the bloomin' cigar!\"\n\nHeywood, laughing, rescued the volume on a long bamboo.\n\n\"Just came out on the look-see, captain,\" he called up. \"Can't board\nyou. Plague ashore.\"\n\n\"Plague be 'anged!\" scoffed the little captain. \"That hole's no worse\nwith plague than't is without. Got two cases on board, myself--coolies.\nStowed 'em topside, under the boats.--Come up here, ye castaway! Come\nup, ye goatskin Robinson Crusoe, and get a white man's chow!\"\n\nHe received them on deck,--a red, peppery little officer, whose shaven\ncheeks and close gray hair gave him the look of a parson gone wrong, a\nhedge-priest run away to sea. Two tall Chinese boys scurried about with\nwicker chairs, with trays of bottles, ice, and cheroots, while he barked\nhis orders, like a fox-terrier commanding a pair of solemn dock-rats.\nThe white men soon lounged beside the wheel-house.\n\n\"So you brought Mrs. Forrester,\" drawled Heywood.\n\nRudolph, wondering if they saw him wince, listened with painful\neagerness. But the captain disposed of that subject very simply.\n\n\"_She's_ no good.\" He stared up at the grimy awning. \"What I'm thinking\nis, will that there Dacca babu at Koprah slip me through his blessed\nquarantine for twenty-five dollars. What?\"\n\nTheir talk drifted far away from Rudolph, far from China itself, to\ntouch a hundred ports and islands, Cebu and Sourabaya, Tavoy and\nSelangor. They talked of men and women, a death at Zamboanga, a birth at\nChittagong, of obscure heroism or suicide, and fortunes made or lost;\nwhile the two boys, gentle, melancholy, gliding silent in bright blue\nrobes, spread a white tablecloth, clamped it with shining brass, and\nlaid the tiffin. Then the talk flowed on, the feast made a tiny clatter\nof jollity in the slumbering noon, in the silence of an ocean and a\ncontinent. And when at last the visitors clambered down the iron side,\nthey went victorious with Spanish wine.\n\n\"Mind ye,\" shouted Captain Kneebone, from the rail, \"that don't half\nexhaust the subjeck o' lott'ries! Why, luck\"--He shook both fists aloft,\ntriumphantly, as if they had been full of money. \"Just ye wait. I've a\ntip from Calcutta that--Never mind. Bar sells, when that fortch'n comes,\nmy boy, the half's yours! Home we go, remember that!\"\n\nThe sampan drew away. Sweeping his arm violently, to threaten the coast\nof China and the whole range of his vision,--\n\n\"You're the one man,\" he roared, \"that makes all this mess--worth a\ncowrie!\"\n\nHeywood laughed, waved his helmet, and when at last he turned, sat\nlooking downward with a queer smile.\n\n\"Illusions!\" he chuckled. \"What would a chap ever do without 'em? Old\nKneebone there: his was always that--a fortune in a lottery, and then\nHome! Illusions! And he's no fool, either. Good navigator. Decent old\nbeggar.\" He waved his helmet again, before stretching out to sleep. \"Do\nyou know, I believe--he _would_ take me.\"\n\nThe clinkered hills, quivering in the west, sank gradually into the\nheated blur above the plains. As gradually, the two men sank\ninto dreams.\n\nFurious, metallic cries from the Pretty Lily woke them, in the blue\ntwilight. She had moored her sampan alongside a flight of stone steps,\nup which, vigorously, with a bamboo, she now prodded her husband. He\ncontended, snarling, but mounted; and when Heywood's silver fell\njingling into her palm, lighted his lantern and scuffed along, a\nchurlish guide. At the head of the slimy stairs, Heywood rattled a\nponderous gate in a wall, and shouted. Some one came running, shot\nbolts, and swung the door inward. The lantern showed the tawny, grinning\nface of a servant, as they passed into a small garden, of dwarf orange\ntrees pent in by a lofty, whitewashed wall.\n\n\"These grounds are yours, Hackh,\" said Heywood. \"Your predecessor's boy;\nand there\"--pointing to a lonely barrack that loomed white over the\nstunted grove--\"there's your house. You draw the largest in the station.\nA Portuguese nunnery, it was, built years ago. My boys are helping set\nit to rights; but if you don't mind, I'd like you to stay on at my\nbeastly hut until this--this business takes a turn. Plenty of time.\" He\nnodded at the fat little orange trees. \"We may live to take our chow\nunder those yet, of an evening. Also a drink. Eh?\"\n\nThe lantern skipped before them across the garden, through a penitential\ncourtyard, and under a vaulted way to the main door and the road. With\nRudolph, the obscure garden and echoing house left a sense of magical\nownership, sudden and fleeting, like riches in the Arabian Nights. The\nroad, leaving on the right a low hill, or convex field, that heaved\nagainst the lower stars, now led the wanderers down a lane of hovels,\namong dim squares of smoky lamplight.\n\nWu, their lantern-bearer, had turned back, and they had begun to pass a\nfew quiet, expectant shops, when a screaming voice, ahead, outraged the\nevening stillness.\n\nAt the first words, Heywood doubled his pace.\n\n\"Come along. Here's a lark--or a tragedy.\"\n\nJostling through a malodorous crowd that blockaded the quarrel, they\ngained the threshold of a lighted shop. Against a rank of orderly\nshelves, a fat merchant stood at bay, silent, quick-eyed, apprehensive.\nBefore him, like an actor in a mad scene, a sobbing ruffian, naked to\nthe waist, convulsed with passion, brandished wild fists and ranted with\nincredible sounds. When breath failed, he staggered, gasping, and swept\nhis audience with the glazed, unmeaning stare of drink or lunacy. The\nmerchant spoke up, timid and deprecating. As though the words were\nvitriol, the other started, whirled face to face, and was seized with a\nnew raving.\n\nSomething protruded at his waistband, like a rudimentary, Darwinian\nstump. To this, all at once, his hand flung back. With a wrench and a\nglitter, he flourished a blade above his head. Heywood sprang to\nintervene, in the same instant that the disturber of trade swept his arm\ndown in frenzy. Against his own body, hilt and fist thumped home, with\nthe sound as of a football lightly punted. He turned, with a freezing\nlook of surprise, plucked at the haft, made one step calmly and\ntentatively toward the door, stumbled, and lay retching and coughing.\n\nThe fat shop-keeper wailed like a man beside himself. He gabbled,\nimploring Heywood. The young man nodded. \"Yes, yes,\" he repeated\nirritably, staring down at the body, but listening to the stream\nof words.\n\nMurmurs had risen, among the goblin faces blinking in the doorway.\nBehind them, a sudden voice called out two words which were caught up\nand echoed harshly in the street. Heywood whipped about.\n\n\"Never called me that before,\" he said quickly. \"Come outside.\"\n\nHe flung back a hurried sentence to the merchant, caught Rudolph's arm,\nand plunged into the crowd. The yellow men gave passage mechanically,\nbut with lowering faces. Once free in the muddy path, he halted quickly,\nand looked about.\n\n\"Might have known,\" he grumbled. \"Never called me 'Foreign Dog' before,\nor 'Jesus man,' He set 'em on.\"\n\nRudolph followed his look. In the dim light, at the outskirts of the\nrabble, a man was turning away, with an air of contempt or unconcern.\nThe long, pale, oval face, the hard eyes gleaming with thought, had\nvanished at a glance. A tall, slight figure, stooping in his long robe,\nhe glided into the darkness. For all his haste, the gait was not the\ngait of a coolie.\n\n\"That,\" said Heywood, turning into their former path, \"that was Fang,\nthe Sword-Pen, so-called. Very clever chap. Of the two most dangerous\nmen in the district, he's one.\" They had swung along briskly for several\nminutes, before he added: \"The other most dangerous man--you've met him\nalready. If I'm not mistaken, he's no less a person than the Reverend\nJames Earle.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Rudolph, in dull bewilderment.\n\n\"Yes,\" grunted his friend. \"The padre. We must find him to-night, and\nreport.\"\n\nHe strode forward, with no more comment. At his side, Rudolph moved as a\nsoldier, carried onward by pressure and automatic rhythm, moves in the\napathy of a forced march. The day had been so real, so wholesome, full\nof careless talk and of sunlight. And now this senseless picture blotted\nall else, and remained,--each outline sharper in memory, the smoky lamp\nbrighter, the blow of the hilt louder, the smell of peanut oil more\npungent. The episode, to him, was a disconnected, unnecessary fragment,\none bloody strand in the whole terrifying snarl. But his companion\nstalked on in silence, like a man who saw a pattern in the web of\nthings, and was not pleased.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nIN TOWN\n\nNight, in that maze of alleys, was but a more sinister day. The same\nslant-eyed men, in broken files, went scuffing over filthy stone, like\nwanderers lost in a tunnel. The same inexplicable noises endured, the\nsame smells. Under lamps, the shaven foreheads still bent toward\nmicroscopic labor. The curtained window of a fantan shop still glowed in\norange translucency, and from behind it came the murmur and the endless\nchinking of cash, where Fortune, a bedraggled, trade-fallen goddess,\nsplit hairs with coolies for poverty or zero. Nothing was altered in\nthese teeming galleries, except that turbid daylight had imperceptibly\ngiven place to this other dimness, in which lanterns swung like tethered\nfire-balloons. Life went on, mysteriously, without change or sleep.\n\nWhile the two white men shouldered their way along, a strange chorus\nbroke out, as though from among the crowded carcasses in a butcher's\nstall. Shrill voices rose in unearthly discord, but the rhythm was\nnot of Asia.\n\n\"There goes the hymn!\" scoffed Heywood. He halted where, between the\nbutcher's and a book-shop, the song poured loud through an open doorway.\nNodding at a placard, he added: \"Here we are: 'Jesus Religion Chapel.'\nHear 'em yanging! 'There is a gate that stands ajar.' That being the\ncase, in you go!\"\n\nEntering a long, narrow room, lighted from sconces at either side, they\nsat down together, like schoolmates, on a low form near the door. From a\ndais across at the further end, the vigorous white head of Dr. Earle\ndominated the company,--a strange company, of lounging Chinamen who\nsucked at enormous bamboo pipes, or squinted aimlessly at the vertical\ninscriptions on the walls, or wriggling about, stared at the\nlate-comers, nudged their neighbors, and pointed, with guttural\nexclamations. The song had ended, and the padre was lifting up his\ngiant's voice. To Rudolph, the words had been mere sound and fury, but\nfor a compelling honesty that needed no translation. This man was not\npreaching to heathen, but talking to men. His eyes had the look of one\nwho speaks earnestly of matters close at hand, direct, and simple. Along\nthe forms, another and another man forgot to plait his queue, or squirm,\nor suck laboriously at his pipe. They listened, stupid or intent. When\nsome waif from the outer labyrinth scuffed in, affable, impudent,\nhailing his friends across the room, he made but a ripple of unrest,\nand sank gaping among the others like a fish in a pool.\n\nEven Heywood sat listening--with more attention than respect, for once\nhe muttered, \"Rot!\" Toward the close, however, he leaned across and\nwhispered, \"The old boy reels it off rather well to-night. Different to\nwhat one imagined.\"\n\nRudolph, for his part, sat watching and listening, surprised by a new\nand curious thought.\n\nA band of huddled converts sang once more, in squealing discords, with\nan air of sad, compulsory, and diabolic sarcasm. A few \"inquirers\"\nslouched forward, and surrounding the tall preacher, questioned him\nconcerning the new faith. The last, a broad, misshapen fellow with\nhanging jowls, was answered sharply. He stood arguing, received another\nsnub, and went out bawling and threatening, with the contorted face and\nclumsy flourishes of some fabulous hero on a screen.\n\nThe missionary approached smiling, but like a man who has finished the\nday's work.\n\n\"That fellow--Good-evening: and welcome to our Street Chapel, Mr.\nHackh--That fellow,\" he glanced after the retreating figure, \"he's a\nlesson in perseverance, gentlemen. A merchant, well-to-do: he has a\nlawsuit coming on--notorious--and tries to join us for protection.\nCheaper to buy a little belief, you know, than to pay Yamen fines.\nEvery night he turns up, grinning and bland. I tell him it won't do, and\nout he goes, snorting like a dragon.\"\n\nRudolph's impulse came to a head.\n\n\"Dr. Earle,\" he stammered, \"I owe you a gratitude. You spoke to these\npeople so--as--I do not know. But I listened, I felt--Before always are\nthey devils, images! And after I hear you, they are as men.\"\n\nThe other shook his great head like a silver mane, and laughed.\n\n\"My dear young man,\" he replied, \"they're remarkably like you and me.\"\n\nAfter a pause, he added soberly:--\n\n\"Images? Yes, you're right, sir. So was Adam. The same clay, the same\nimage.\" His deep voice altered, his eyes lighted shrewdly, as he turned\nto Heywood. \"This is an unexpected pleasure.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" said the young man, readily. \"If you don't mind, padre, you\nmade Number One talk. Fast bowling, and no wides. But we really came for\nsomething else.\" In a few brief sentences, he pictured the death in the\nshop.--So, like winking! The beggar gave himself the iron, fell down,\nand made finish. Now what I pieced out, from his own bukhing, and the\nmerchant's, was this:--\n\n\"The dead man was one Au-yoeng, a cormorant-fisher. Some of his best\nbirds died, he had a long run of bad luck, and came near starving. So he\ncontrived, rather cleverly, to steal about a hundred catties of Fuh-kien\nhemp. The owner, this merchant, went to the elders of Au-yoeng's\nneighborhood, who found and restored the hemp, nearly all. Merchant lets\nthe matter drop. But the neighbors kept after this cormorant fellow,\nworked one beastly squeeze or another, ingenious baiting, devilish--Rot!\nyou know their neighborhoods better than I! Well, they pushed him\ndown-hill--poor devil, showing that's always possible, no bottom! He\nbrooded, and all that, till he thought the merchant and the Jesus\nreligion were the cause of all. So bang he goes down the\npole,--gloriously drunk,--marches into his enemy's shop, and uses that\nknife. The joke is now on the merchant, eh?\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" begged the padre. \"One thread I don't follow--the\nreligion. Who was Christian? The merchant?\"\n\n\"Well, rather! Thought I told you,\" said Heywood. \"One of yours--big,\nmild chap--Chok Chung.\"\n\nThe elder man sat musing.\n\n\"Yes,\" the deep bass rumbled in the empty chapel, \"he's one of us.\nExtremely honest. I'm--I'm very sorry. There may be trouble.\"\n\n\"Must be, sir,\" prompted the younger. \"The mob, meanwhile, just stood\nthere, dumb,--mutes and audience, you know. All at once, the hindmost\nbegan squalling 'Foreign Dog,' 'Goat Man.' We stepped outside, and\nthere, passing, if you like, was that gentle bookworm, Mr. Fang.\"\n\n\"Fang?\" echoed the padre, as in doubt. \"I've heard the name.\"\n\n\"Heard? Why, doctor,\" cried Heywood, \"that long, pale chap,--lives over\ntoward the Dragon Spring. Confucian, very strict; keen reader; might be\na mandarin, but prefers the country gentleman sort; bally\nmischief-maker, he's done more people in the eye than all the Yamen\nhacks and all their false witnesses together! Hence his nickname--the\nSword-Pen.\"\n\nDr. Earle sharpened his heavy brows, and studied the floor.\n\n\"Fang, the Sword-Pen,\" he growled; \"yes, there will be trouble. He hates\nus. Given this chance--Humph! Saul of Tarsus.--We're not the Roman\nChurch,\" he added, with his first trace of irritation. \"Always\noccurring, this thing.\"\n\nOnce more he meditated; then heaved his big shoulders to let slip the\nwhole burden.\n\n\"One day at a time,\" he laughed. \"Thank you for telling us.--You see,\nMr. Hackh, they're not devils. The only fault is, they're just human\nbeings. You don't speak the language? I'll send you my old teacher.\"\n\nThey talked of things indifferent; and when the young men were stumbling\nalong the streets, he called after them a resounding \"Good-night!\nThanks!\"--and stood a resolute, gigantic silhouette, filling, as a right\nDoone filled their doorframe, the entrance to his deserted chapel.\n\nAt his gate, felt Rudolph, they had unloaded some weight of\nresponsibility. He had not only accepted it, but lightened them further,\ngirt them, by a word and a look. Somehow, for the first time since\nlanding, Rudolph perceived that through this difficult, troubled,\nignorant present, a man might burrow toward a future gleam. The feeling\nwas but momentary. As for Heywood, he still marched on grimly, threading\nthe stuffed corridors like a man with a purpose.\n\n\"No dinner!\" he snapped. \"Catchee bymby, though. We must see Wutzler\nfirst. To lose sight of any man for twenty-four hours, nowadays,--Well,\nit's not hardly fair. Is it?\"\n\nThey turned down a black lane, carpeted with dry rubbish. At long\nintervals, a lantern guttering above a door showed them a hand's-breadth\nof the dirty path, a litter of broken withes and basket-weavers' refuse,\nbetween the mouldy wall of the town and a row of huts, no less black and\nsilent. In this greasy rift the air lay thick, as though smeared into\na groove.\n\nSuddenly, among the hovels, they groped along a checkered surface of\nbrick-work. The flare of Heywood's match revealed a heavy wooden door,\nwhich he hammered with his fist. After a time, a disgruntled voice\nwithin snarled something in the vernacular. Heywood laughed.\n\n\"Ai-yah! Who's afraid? Wutzler, you old pirate, open up!\"\n\nA bar clattered down, the door swung back, and there, raising a\nglow-worm lantern of oiled paper, stood such a timorous little figure as\nmight have ventured out from a masquerade of gnomes. The wrinkled face\nwas Wutzler's, but his weazened body was lost in the glossy black folds\nof a native jacket, and below the patched trousers, his bare ankles and\ncoolie-sandals of straw moved uneasily, as though trying to hide behind\neach other.\n\n\"Kom in,\" said this hybrid, with a nervous cackle. \"I thought you are\nthiefs. Kom in.\"\n\nFollowing through a toy courtyard, among shadow hints of pigmy shrubs\nand rockery, they found themselves cramped in a bare, clean cell,\nlighted by a European lamp, but smelling of soy and Asiatics. Stiff\nblack-wood chairs lined the walls. A distorted landscape on rice-paper,\nnarrow scarlet panels inscribed with black cursive characters, pith\nflowers from Amoy, made blots of brightness.\n\n\"It iss not moch, gentlemen,\" sighed Wutzler, cringing. \"But I am ver'\nglad.\"\n\nHeywood flung himself into a chair.\n\n\"Not dead yet, you rascal?\" he cried. \"And we came all the way to see\nyou. No chow, either.\"\n\n\"Oh, allow me,\" mumbled their host, in a flutter. \"My--she--I will\nspeak, I go bring you.\" He shuffled away, into some further chamber.\n\nHeywood leaned forward quickly.\n\n\"Eat it,\" he whispered, \"whether you can or not! Pleases the old one, no\nbounds. We're his only visitors--\"\n\n\"Here iss not moch whiskey.\" Wutzler came shambling in, held a bottle\nagainst the light, and squinted ruefully at the yellow dregs. \"I will\ngif you a _kong_ full, but I haf not.\"\n\nHe dodged out again. They heard his angry whispers, and a small\ncommotion of the household,--brazen dishes clinking, squeals, titters,\nand tiny bare feet skipping about,--all the flurry of a rabbit-hutch in\nWonderland. Once, near the threshold, a chubby face, very pale, with\nround eyes of shining jet, peered cautious as a mouse, and popped out of\nsight with a squeak. Wutzler, red with excitement, came and went like an\nanxious waiter, bringing in the feast.\n\n\"Here iss not moch,\" he repeated sadly. But there were bits of pig-skin\nstewed in oil; bean-cakes; steaming buns of wheat-flour, stuffed with\ndice of fat pork and lumps of sugar; three-cornered rice puddings,\n_no-me_ boiled in plantain-leaf wrappers; with the last of the whiskey,\nin green cups. While the two men ate, the shriveled outcast beamed\ntimidly, hovering about them, fidgeting.\n\n\"Herr Hackh,\" he suddenly exclaimed, in a queer, strained voice, \"you do\nnot know how dis yong man iss goot! No! He hass to me--_immer_--\" He\nchoked, turned away, and began fussing with the pith flowers; but not\nbefore Rudolph had seen a line glistening down the sun-dried cheeks.\n\n\"Stuff! Cadging for chow, does one acquire merit?\" retorted Heywood,\nover his shoulder. \"You talk like a bonze, Wutz.\" He winked. \"I'd rather\nhear the sing-song box.\"\n\n\"_Ach so_, I forget!\" Still whimpering, Wutzler dragged something from a\ncorner, squatted, and jerked at a crank, with a noise of ratchets. \"She\nblay not so moch now,\" he snuffled. \"Captain Kneepone he has gifen her,\nwhen she iss all op inside for him. I haf rebaired, but she blay only\none song yet. A man does not know, Herr Hackh, what he may be. Once I\nhaf piano, and viola my own, yes, and now haf I diss small, laffing,\nsick teufel!\" He rose, and faced Heywood with a trembling, passionate\ngesture. \"But diss yong man, he stand by der oldt fellow!\" The streaming\neyes blinked absurdly.\n\nBehind him, with a whirring sound, a metallic voice assailed them in a\ngabble of words, at first husky and broken, then clear, nasal, a voice\nfrom neither Europe nor Asia, but America:--\n\n\n\"Then did I laff?\nOoh, aha-ha ha ha,\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha!\nI could not help but laffing,\nOoh, aha-ha ...\"\n\n\nFrom a throat of tin, it mocked them insanely with squealing,\nblack-hearted guffaws. Heywood sat smoking, with the countenance of a\nstoic; but when the laughter in the box was silent, he started abruptly.\n\n\"We're off, old chap,\" he announced. \"Bedtime. Just came to see you were\nall up-standing. Tough as ever? Good! Don't let--er--anything carry\nyou off.\"\n\nAt the gate, Wutzler held aloft his glow-worm lantern.\n\n\"Dose fellows catch me?\" he mumbled, \"Der plagues--dey will forget me.\nAll zo many shoots, _kugel_, der bullet,--'_gilt's mir, oder gilt es\ndir?_' Men are dead in der Silk-Weafer Street. Dey haf hong up nets, and\ndorns, to keep out der plague's-goblins off deir house. Listen, now, dey\nbeat gongs!--But we are white men. You--you tell me zo, to-night!\" He\nblubbered something incoherent, but as the gate slammed they heard the\nname of God, in a broken benediction.\n\nThey had groped out of the cleft, and into a main corridor, before\nHeywood paused.\n\n\"That devil in the box!\" He shook himself like a spaniel. \"Queer it\nshould get into me so. But I hate being laughed at by--anybody.\"\n\nA confused thunder of gongs, the clash of cymbals smothered in the\ndistance, maintained a throbbing uproar, pierced now and then by savage\nyells, prolonged and melancholy. As the two wanderers listened,--\n\n\"Where's the comfort,\" said Heywood, gloomily, \"of knowing somebody's\nworse off?--No, I wasn't thinking of Wutzler, then. Talk of germs! why,\nover there, it's goblins they're scaring away. Think, behind their nets\nand thorns, what wretches--women, too, and kids--may be crouched down,\nquaking, sick with terror. Humph!--I don't mind saying\"--for a moment\nhis hand lay on Rudolph's shoulder--\"that I loathe giving this muck-hole\nthe satisfaction--I'd hate to go Out here, that's all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nTHE PAGODA\n\nHe was spared that inconvenience. The untimely rain and cold, some\npersons said, the few days of untimely heat following, had drowned or\ndried, frozen or burnt out, the seeds of peril. But accounts varied,\nreasons were plentiful. Soldiers had come down from the chow city,\ntwo-score _li_ inland, and charging through the streets, hacking and\nslashing the infested air, had driven the goblins over the walls, with a\ngreat shout of victory. A priest had freighted a kite with all the evil,\nthen cut it adrift in the sky. A mob had dethroned the God of Sickness,\nand banished his effigy in a paper junk, launched on the river at night,\nin flame. A geomancer proclaimed that a bamboo grove behind the town\nformed an angle most correct, germane, and pleasant to the Azure Dragon\nand the White Tiger, whose occult currents, male and female, run\nthroughout Nature. For any or all of these reasons, the town was\ndelivered. The pestilence vanished, as though it had come but to grant\nMonsieur Jolivet his silence, and to add a few score uncounted living\nwretches to the dark, mighty, imponderable host of ancestors.\n\nThe relief, after dragging days of uncertainty, came to Rudolph like a\nsea-breeze to a stoker. To escape and survive,--the bare experience\nseemed to him at first an act of merit, the deed of a veteran. The\ninterim had been packed with incongruity. There had been a dinner with\nKempner, solemn, full of patriotism and philosophy; a drunken dinner at\nTeppich's; another, and a worse, at Nesbit's; and the banquet of a\nnative merchant, which began at four o'clock on melon-seeds, tea, black\nyearling eggs, and a hot towel, and ended at three in the morning on\nrice-brandy and betel served by unreal women with chalked faces and\nvermilion-spotted lips, simpering and melancholy. By day, there was\nwork, or now and then a lesson with Dr. Earle's teacher, a little aged\nChinaman of intricate, refined, and plaintive courtesy. Under his\nguidance Rudolph learned rapidly, taking to study as a prodigal might\ntake to drink. And with increasing knowledge came increasing\ntranquillity; as when he found that the hideous cry, startling him at\nevery dawn, was the signal not for massacre, but buffalo-milk.\n\nThen, too, came the mild excitement of moving into his own house, the\nPortuguese nunnery. Through its desolate, lime-coated spaces, his meagre\nbelongings were scattered all too easily; but the new servants, their\nwords and ways, not only kept his hands full, but gave strange food for\nthought. The silent evenings, timed by the plash of a frog in a pool, a\ncry from the river, or the sing-song of a \"boy\" improvising some endless\nballad below-stairs; drowsy noons above the little courtyard, bare and\npeaceful as a jail; homesick moments at the window, when beyond the\nstunted orangery, at sunset, the river was struck amazingly from bronze\nto indigo, or at dawn flashed from pearl-gray to flowing brass;--all\nthese, and nights between sleep and waking, when fancy peopled the\nechoing chambers with the visionary lives, now ended, of meek, brown\nsisters from Goa or Macao, gave to Rudolph intimations, vague, profound,\nand gravely happy, as of some former existence almost recaptured. Once\nmore he felt himself a householder in the Arabian tales.\n\nAnd yet, when his life was growing all but placid, across it shot some\ntremor of disquieting knowledge.\n\nOne evening, after a busy day among his piece-goods, he had walked\nafield with Heywood, and back by an aimless circuit through the\ntwilight. His companion had been taciturn, of late; and they halted,\nwithout speaking, where a wide pool gleamed toward a black, fantastic\nbelt of knotted willows and sharp-curving roofs. Through these broke the\nshadow of a small pagoda, jagged as a war-club of shark's teeth. Vesper\ncymbals clashed faintly in a temple, and from its open door the first\nplummet of lamplight began to fathom the dark margin. A short bridge\ncurved high, like a camel's hump, over the glimmering half-circle of a\nsingle arch. Close by, under a drooping foreground of branches, a stake\nupheld an oblong placard of neat symbols, like a cartouche to explain\na painting.\n\n\"It is very beautiful,\" ventured Rudolph, twisting up his blond\nmoustache with satisfaction. \"Very sightly. I would say--picturesque, no?\"\n\n\"Very,\" said Heywood, absently. \"Willow Pattern.\"\n\n\"And the placard, so finishing, so artistic--That says?\"\n\n\"Eh, what? Oh, I wasn't listening.\" Heywood glanced carelessly at the\nupright sentence. That's a notice:--\n\n\"'Girls May Not be Drowned in This Pond.'\"\n\nHe started on, without comment. Without reply, Rudolph followed,\ngathering as he walked the force of this tremendous hint. Slow,\nfar-reaching, it poisoned the elegiac beauty of the scene, alienated the\nnight, and gave to the fading country-side a yet more ancient look,\nsombre and implacable. He was still pondering this, when across their\nwinding foot-path, with a quick thud of hoofs, swept a pair of\nequestrian silhouettes. It was half glimpse, half conjecture,--the tough\nlittle ponies trotting stubbornly, a rider who leaned across laughing,\nand a woman who gayly cried at him: \"You really do understand me, don't\nyou?\" The two jogging shadows melted in the bamboo tracery, like things\nblown down the wind. But for years Rudolph had known the words, the\nlaugh, the beguiling cadence, and could have told what poise of the head\nwent with them, what dangerous glancing light. Suddenly, without reason,\nhe felt a gust of rage. It was he that understood. It was to him these\nthings belonged. The memory of her weakness was lost in the shining\nmemory of her power. He should be riding there, in the dusk of this\nlonely and cruel land.\n\nHeywood had thrown after them a single gloomy stare, down the pointed\naisle of bamboos.\n\n\"Well matched!\" he growled. \"Chantel--He bounds in the saddle, and he\nbounds afoot!\"\n\nRudolph knew that he had hated Chantel at sight.\n\nHe could not bring himself, next day, to join their party for tiffin at\nthe Flowery Pagoda. But in the midst of his brooding, Teppich and the\nfat Sturgeon assailed the nunnery gate with pot-valiant blows and\nshouts. They had brought chairs, to carry him off; and being in no mood\nto fail, though panting and struggling, they packed him into a\npalanquin with many bottles of the best wine known to Fliegelman and\nSons. By a short cut through the streets--where checkered sunshine,\nthrough the lattice roof, gave a muddy, subdued light as in a roiled\naquarium--the revelers passed the inland wall. Here, in the shade,\ngrooms awaited them with ponies; and scrambling into saddle, they\ntrotted off through gaps in the bamboos, across a softly rolling\ncountry. Tortuous foot-paths of vivid pink wound over brilliant green\nterraces of young paddy. The pink crescents of new graves scarred the\nhillsides, already scalloped and crinkled with shelving abodes of the\nvenerable dead. Great hats of farmers stooping in the fields, gleamed in\nthe sun like shields of brass. Over knolls and through hollows the\nlittle cavalcade jogged steadily, till, mounting a gentle eminence, they\nwound through a grove of camphor and Flame-of-the-Forest. Above the\nbranches rose the faded lilac shaft of an ancient pagoda, ruinously\nadorned with young trees and wild shrubs clinging in the cornices.\n\nAt the foot of this aged fantasy in stone, people were laughing. The\nthree riders broke cover in time to see Mrs. Forrester, flushed and\nradiant, end some narrative with a droll pantomime. She stood laughing,\nthe life and centre of a delighted group.\n\n\"And Gilbert Forrester,\" she cried, turning archly on her husband,\n\"said that wasn't funny!\"\n\nGilly tugged his gray moustache, in high good-nature. Chantel, Nesbit,\nand Kempner laughed uproariously, the padre and the dark-eyed Miss Drake\nquietly, Heywood more quietly, while even stout, uneasy Mrs. Earle\nsmiled as in duty bound. A squad of Chinese boys, busy with\ntiffin-baskets, found time to grin. To this lively actress in the white\ngown they formed a sylvan audience under the gnarled boughs and\nthe pagoda.\n\n\"Too late!\" called the white-haired giant, indulgently, to the\ndismounting trio. \"Mr. Hackh, you should have come spurring.\"\n\nRudolph advanced, pale, but with a calmness of which, afterward, he was\njustly proud. The heroine of the moment turned toward him quickly, with\na look more natural, more sincere, than she had ever given him.\n\n\"Is this Mr. Hackh?\" she said graciously. \"I've heard so much about\nyou!\"\n\nThe young man himself was almost deceived. Was there a German mail-boat?\nWas there a club, from which he had stolen out while she wept,\nignominiously, in that girl's arms? And then of a sudden he perceived,\nwith a fatuous pleasure, how well she knew him, to know that he had\nnever spoken. His English, as he drew up a stool beside Miss Drake, was\nwild and ragged; but he found her an astonishing refuge. For the first\ntime, he recalled that this quiet girl had been beautiful, the other\nnight; and though now by day that beauty was rather of line than of\ncolor, he could not understand how it had been overlooked. Tiffin,\nmeanwhile, sped by like an orgy. He remembered asking so many questions,\nabout the mission hospital and her school for orphans, that the girl\nbegan at last to answer with constraint, and with puzzled, sidelong\nscrutiny. He remembered how even the tolerant Heywood shot a questioning\nglance toward his wine-glass. He remembered telling a brilliant story,\nand reciting \"Old Captain Mau in Vegesack,\"--rhymes long forgotten, now\nfluent and spontaneous. The applause was a triumph. Through it, as\nthrough a haze, he saw a pair of wide blue eyes shining with startled\nadmiration.\n\nBut the best came when the sun had lowered behind the grove, the company\ngrown more silent, and Mrs. Forrester, leaning beside the door of the\ntower, turned the great pegs of a Chinese lute. The notes tinkled like a\nmandolin, but with now and then an alien wail, a lament unknown to the\nWest. \"Sing for us,\" begged the dark-eyed girl; \"a native song.\" The\nother smiled, and bending forward as if to recollect, began in a low\nvoice, somewhat veiled, but musical and full of meaning. \"The Jasmine\nFlower,\" first; then, \"My Love is Gathering Dolichos\"; and then she\nsang the long Ballad of the Rice,--of the husband and wife planting side\nby side, the springing of the green blades, the harvest by millions upon\nmillions of sheaves, the wealth of the State, more fragrant to ancestors\nthan offerings of spice:--\n\n\n\"...O Labor and Love and hallowed Land!\nThink you these things are but still to come?\nThink you they are but near at hand,\nOnly now and here?--Behold.\nThey were the same in years of old!\"\n\n\nIn her plaintive interlude, the slant-eyed servants watched her, nodding\nand muttering under the camphor trees.\n\n\"And here's a song of exile,\" she said. \"I render it very\nbadly.\"--Rudolph had never seen her face like this, bending intently\nabove the lute. It was as though in the music she found and disclosed\nherself, without guile.\n\n\n\"...Blue was the sky,\nAnd blue the rice-pool water lay\nHolding the sky;\nBlue was the robe she wore that day.\nAlas, my sorrow! Why\nMust life bear all away,\nAway, away,\nAh, my beloved, why?\"\n\n\nA murmur of praise went round the group, as she put aside the\ninstrument.\n\n\"The sun's getting low,\" she said lightly, \"and I _must_ see that view\nfrom the top.\" Chantel was rising, but sat down again with a scowl, as\nshe turned to Rudolph. \"You've never seen it, Mr. Hackh? Do come help\nme up.\"\n\nInside, with echoing steps, they mounted in a squalid well, obscurely\nlighted from the upper windows, toward which decaying stairs rose in a\ndangerous spiral, without guard-rail. A misstep being no trifle, Rudolph\noffered his hand for the mere safety; but she took it with a curious\nlittle laugh. They climbed cautiously. Once, at a halt, she stood very\nclose, with eyes shining large in the dusk. Her slight body trembled,\nher head shook with stifled merriment, like a girl overcome by mischief.\n\n\"What a queer little world!\" she whispered. \"You and I here!--I never\ndreamed you could be funny. It made me so proud of you, down there!\"\n\nHe muttered something vague; and--the stairs ending in ruin at the\nfourth story--handed her carefully through the window to a small outer\nbalustrade. As they stood together at the rail, he knew not whether to\nbe angry, suspicious, or glad.\n\n\"I love this prospect,\" she began quietly. \"That's why I wanted you to\ncome.\"\n\nBeyond the camphors, a wide, strange landscape glowed in the full,\nlow-streaming light. The ocean lay a sapphire band in the east; in the\nwest, on a long ridge, undulated the gray battlements of a city, the\nantique walls, warmed and glorified, breasting the flood of sunset. All\nbetween lay vernal fields and hillocks, maidenhair sprays of bamboo, and\na wandering pattern of pink foot-paths. Slowly along one of these, a\nbright-gowned merchant rode a white pony, his bells tinkling in the\nstillness of sea and land. Everywhere, like other bells more tiny and\nshrill, sounded the trilling of frogs.\n\nAs the two on the pagoda stood listening,--\n\n\"It was before Rome,\" she declared thoughtfully. \"Before Egypt, and has\nnever changed. You and I are just--\" She broke off, humming:--\n\n\n\"Only here and now? Behold\nThey were the same in years of old!\"\n\n\nHer mood  the scene: the aged continuity of life oppressed him.\nYet he chose rather to watch the straggling battlements, far off, than\nto meet her eyes or see her hair gleaming in the sun. Through many\ntroubled days he had forgotten her, despised her, bound his heart in\ntriple brass against a future in her hateful neighborhood; and now,\nbeside her at this time-worn rail, he was in danger of being happy. It\nwas inglorious. He tried to frown.\n\n\"You poor boy.\" Suddenly, with an impulse that must have been generous,\nshe rested her hand on his arm. \"I was sorry. I thought of you\nso often.\"\n\nAt these close quarters, her tremulous voice and searching upward glance\nmeant that she alone understood all his troubles. He started, turned for\nsome rush of overwhelming speech, when a head popped through the window\nbehind them.\n\n\"Boot and saddle, Mrs. Forrester,\" announced Heywood. His lean young\nface was very droll and knowing. \"We're leaving, bottom-side.\"\n\n\"Thank you so much, Maurice,\" she answered, perhaps dryly. \"You're a\ndear, to climb all those dreadful stairs.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Heywood, with his gray eyes fastened on Rudolph, \"no\ntrouble.\"\n\nAll three went down the dark well together.\n\nWhen the company were mounted, and trooping downhill through the camphor\nshadow, Heywood's pony came sidling against Rudolph's, till legging\nchafed legging.\n\n\"You blossomed, old boy,\" he whispered. \"Quite the star, after your\ncomedy turn.\" He reined aside, grinning. \"What price sympathy on\na pagoda?\"\n\nFor that moment, Rudolph could have struck down the one sure friend he\nhad in China.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nIPHIGENIA\n\n\"Don't chop off a hen's head with a battle-axe.\" Heywood, still with a\nmalicious, friendly quirk at the corners of his mouth, held in his\nfretful pony. Rudolph stood bending a whip viciously. They two had\nfetched a compass about the town, and now in the twilight were parting\nbefore the nunnery gate. \"A tiff's the last thing I'd want with you. The\nlady, in confidence, is not worth--\"\n\n\"I do not wish,\" declared Rudolph, trembling,--\"I do not wish you to say\nthose things, so!\"\n\n\"Right!\" laughed the other, and his pony wheeled at the word. \"I'll give\nyou one month--no: you're such a good, thorough little chap, it will\ntake longer--two months, to change your mind. Only\"--he looked down at\nRudolph with a comic, elderly air--\"let me observe, our yellow people\nhave that rather neat proverb. A hen's head, dear chap,--not with a\nbattle-axe! No. Hot weather's coming, too. No sorrows of Werther, now,\nover such\"--He laughed again. \"Don't scowl, I'll be good. I won't say\nit. You'll supply the word, in two months!\"\n\nHe let the pony have his way, and was off in a clatter. Lonely, fuming\nwith resentment, Rudolph stared after him. What could he know, this\nairy, unfeeling meddler, so free with his advice and innuendo? Let him\ngo, then, let him canter away. He had seen quickly, guessed with a\ndiabolic shrewdness, yet would remain on the surface, always, of a\nmystery so violent and so profound. The young man stalked into his\nvacant nunnery in a rage, a dismal pomp of emotion: reason telling him\nthat a friend had spoken sense, imagination clothing him in the sceptred\npall of tragedy.\n\nYet one of these unwelcome words had stuck: he was Werther, it was\ntrue--a man who came too late. Another word was soon fulfilled; for the\nhot weather came, sudden, tropical, ferocious. Without gradation, the\nvernal days and languid noons were gone in a twinkling. The change came\nlike another act of a play. One morning--though the dawn stirred cool\nand fragrant as all dawns before--the \"boy\" laid out Rudolph's white\ntunic, slipped in the shining buttons, smeared pipe-clay on his heaviest\nhelmet; and Rudolph, looking from his window, saw that on the river, by\nthe same instinct, boatmen were stretching up their bamboo awnings.\nBreakfast was hardly ended, before river, and convex field, and huddling\nred tiles of the town, lay under a blurred, quivering distortion. The\nday flamed. At night, against a glow of fiery umber, the western hills\nbroke sharp and thin as sheet-iron, while below them rose in flooding\nmirage a bright strip of magical water.\n\nThus, in these days, he rode for his exercise while the sun still lay\nbehind the ocean; and thus her lively, pointed face and wide blue eyes,\nwondering or downcast or merry, were mingled in his thoughts with the\nfirst rousing of the world, the beat of hoofs in cool silences, the wide\nlights of creation over an aged, weary, alien empire. Their ponies\nwhinnying like old friends, they met, by chance or appointment, before\nthe power of sleep had lifted from eyes still new and strange against\nthe morning. Sometimes Chantel the handsome rode glowering beside them,\nsometimes Gilly, erect and solid in the saddle, laid upon their talk all\nthe weight of his honest, tired commonplaces.\n\nBut one morning she cantered up alone, laughing at her escape. His pony\nbolted, and they raced along together as comrades happily join forces in\na headlong dream. Quivering bamboo swept behind them; the river, on\ntheir other hand, met and passed in hurrying panorama. They had no time\nfor words, but only laughter. Words, indeed, had never yet advanced them\nbeyond that moment on the pagoda. And now, when their ponies fell into\na shambling trot, came the first impulse of speech.\n\n\"How lucky!\" she cried. \"How lucky we came this way! Now I can really\ntest you!\"\n\nHe turned. Her glowing face was now averted, her gesture was not for\nhim, but for the scene. He studied that, to understand her.\n\nThe river, up which they had fled, now rested broad and quiet as a\nshallow lake, burnished faintly, brooded over by a floating, increasing\nlight, not yet compounded into day. Tussocks, innumerable clods and\ncrumbs of vivid green, speckled all the nearer water. On some of these\nstorks meditated,--sage, pondering heads and urbane bodies perched high\non the frailest penciling of legs. In the whole expanse, no movement\ncame but when a distant bird, leaving his philosophic pose, plunged\ndownward after a fish. Beyond them rose a shapeless mound or isle, like\nsome half-organic monster grounded in his native ooze.\n\n\"There!\" said the woman, pointing. \"Are you all excuses, like the\nothers? Or do you dare?\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of anything--now,\" retorted Rudolph, and with truth,\nafter the dash of their twilight encounter. \"Dare what?\"\n\n\"Go see what's on that island,\" she answered. \"I dared them all. Twice\nI've seen natives land there and hurry away. Mr. Nesbit was too lazy to\ntry; Dr. Chantel wearing his best clothes. Maurice Heywood refused to\nmire his horse for a whim. Whim? It's a mystery! Come, now. Do\nyou dare?\"\n\nIn a rare flush of pride, Rudolph wheeled his stubborn mount and bullied\nhim down the bank. A poor horseman, he would have outstripped Curtius to\nthe gulf. But no sooner had his dancing pony consented to make the first\nrebellious, sidelong plunge, than he had small joy of his boast.\nFore-legs sank floundering, were hoisted with a terrified wrench of the\nshoulders, in the same moment that hind-legs went down as by suction.\nThe pony squirmed, heaved, wrestled in a frenzy, and churning the red\nwater about his master's thighs, went deeper and fared worse. With a\nclangor of wings, the storks rose, a streaming rout against the sky,\ntrailed their tilted legs, filed away in straggling flight, like figures\ninterlacing on a panel. At the height of his distress, Rudolph caught a\nwhirling glimpse of the woman above him, safe on firm earth, easy in her\nsaddle, and laughing. Quicksand, then, was a joke,--but he could not\npause for this added bewilderment.\n\nThe pony, using a skill born of agony, had found somewhere a solid verge\nand scrambled up, knee-deep, well out from the bank. With a splash,\nRudolph stood beside him among the tufts of salad green. As he patted\nthe trembling flanks, he heard a cry from the shore.\n\n\"Oh, well done!\" she mocked them. \"Well done!\"\n\nA gust of wholesome anger refreshed him. She might laugh, but now he\nwould see this folly through. He tore off his coat, flung it across the\nsaddle, waded out alone through the tussocks, and shooting forward full\nlength in the turbid water, swam resolutely for the island.\n\nSky and water brightened while he swam; and as he rose, wrapped in the\nleaden weight of dripping clothes, the sun, before and above him,\ntouched wonderfully the quaggy bank and parched grasses. He lurched\nashore, his feet caked with enormous clods as of melting chocolate. A\nfilthy scramble left him smeared and disheveled on the summit. He had\ncome for nothing. The mound lay vacant, a tangled patch, a fragment of\nwilderness.\n\nYet as he stood panting, there rose a puny, miserable sound. What\npresence could lurk there? The distress, it might be, of some small\nanimal--a rabbit dying in a forgotten trap. Faint as illusion, a wail, a\nthin-spun thread of sorrow, broke into lonely whimpering, and ceased. He\nmoved forward, doubtfully, and of a sudden, in the scrubby level of the\nisle, stumbled on the rim of a shallow circular depression.\n\nAt first, he could not believe the discovery; but next instant--as at\nthe temple pond, though now without need of placard or interpreter--he\nunderstood. This bowl, a tiny crater among the weeds, showed like some\npaltry valley of Ezekiel, a charnel place of Herod's innocents, the\nbattlefield of some babes' crusade. A chill struck him, not from the\nwater or the early mists. In stupor, he viewed that savage fact.\n\nThrough the stillness of death sounded again the note of living\ndiscontent. He was aware also of some stir, even before he spied, under\na withered clump, the saffron body of an infant girl, feebly squirming.\nBy a loathsome irony, there lay beside her an earthen bowl of rice, as\nan earnest or symbol of regret.\n\nBlind pity urged him into the atrocious hollow. Seeing no further than\nthe present rescue, he caught up the small unclean sufferer, who moaned\nthe louder as he carried her down the bank, and waded out through the\nsludge. To hold the squalling mouth above water, and swim, was no simple\nfeat; yet at last he came floundering among the tussocks, wrapped the\nnaked body in his jacket, and with infinite pains tugged his terrified\npony along a tortuous bar to the land.\n\nOnce in the river-path, he stood gloomily, and let Mrs. Forrester canter\nup to join him. Indeed, he had almost forgotten her.\n\n\"Splendid!\" she laughed. \"What a figure of fun! But what can you have\nbrought back? Oh, please! I can't wait!\"\n\nHe turned on her a muddy, haggard face, without enthusiasm, and gently\nunfolded the coat. The man and the woman looked down together, in\nsilence, at the child. He had some foolish hope that she would take it,\nthat his part was ended. Like an outlandish doll, with face contorted\nand thick-lidded eyes shut tightly against the sunshine, the outcast\nwhimpered, too near the point of death for even the rebellion of\narms and legs.\n\nThe woman in the saddle gave a short, incredulous cry. Her face, all gay\ncuriosity, had darkened in a shock of disgust.\n\n\"What in the world!\" she scolded. \"Oh! Such a nasty little--Why\ndid--What do you propose doing with it?\"\n\nRudolph shook his head, like a man caught in some stupid blunder.\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" he explained heavily. \"She has no--no\nfriends.\"\n\n\"Cover it,\" his companion ordered. \"Cover it up. I can't bear to see\nit.\"\n\nWith a sombre, disappointed air, he obeyed; then looked up, as if in her\nface he read strange matter.\n\n\"I can't bear,\" she added quickly, \"to see any kind of suffering. Why\ndid--It's all my fault for sending you! We were having such a good ride\ntogether, and now I've spoiled it all, with this.--Poor little filthy\nobject!\" She turned her hands outward, with a helpless, dainty gesture.\n\"But what can we do? These things happen every day.\"\n\nRudolph was studying the ground again. His thoughts, then, had wronged\nher. Drenched and downhearted, holding this strange burden in his\njacket, he felt that he had foolishly meddled in things inevitable,\nbeyond repair. She was right. Yet some vague, insurgent instinct, which\nwould not down, told him that there had been a disappointment. Still,\nwhat had he expected? No woman could help; no woman.\n\nThen suddenly he mounted, bundle and all, and turned his willing pony\nhomeward.\n\n\"Come,\" he said; and for the first time, unwittingly, had taken charge.\n\n\"What is it?\" she called. \"You foolish boy! What's your plan?\"\n\n\"We shall see,\" he answered. Without waiting, he beckoned her to follow.\nShe came. They rode stirrup to stirrup, silent as in their escape at\ndawn, and as close bodily, but in spirit traveling distant parallels. He\ngave no thought to that, riding toward his experiment. Near the town, at\nlast, he reined aside to a cluster of buildings,--white walls and rosy\ntiles under a great willow.\n\n\"You may save your steps,\" she declared, with sudden petulance. \"The\nhospital's more out of funds than ever, and more crowded. They'll not\nthank you.\"\n\nRudolph nodded back at her, with a queer smile, half reckless and half\nconfident.\n\n\"Then,\" he replied, dismounting, \"I will replenish my nunnery.\"\n\nSquatting coolies sprang up and raced to hold his pony. Others, in the\nshade of the wall, cackled when they saw a Son of the Red-Haired so\nbeplastered and sopping. A few pointed at his bundle, with grunts of\nsudden interest; and a leper, bearing the visage as of a stone lion\ndefaced by time, cried something harshly. At his words, the whole band\nof idlers began to chatter.\n\nRudolph turned to aid his companion. She sat watching them sharply. An\nuneasy light troubled the innocent blue eyes, which had not even a\nglance for him.\n\n\"No, I shan't get down,\" she said angrily. \"It's just what might\nbe--Your little brat will bring no good to any of us.\"\n\nHe flung away defiantly, strode through the gate, and calling aloud,\ntraversed an empty compound, already heated by the new-risen sun. A\ncooler fringe of veranda, or shallow cloister, lined a second court. Two\nfigures met him,--the dark-eyed Miss Drake, all in white, and behind\nher a shuffling, grinning native woman, who carried a basin, in which\npermanganate of potash swam gleaming like diluted blood.\n\n\"Good-morning.\" With one droll look of amusement, the girl had\nunderstood, and regained that grave yet happy, friendly composure which\nhad the virtue, he discovered, of being easily forgotten, to be met each\ntime like something new. \"What have you there for us?\"\n\nAgain he unfolded the jacket.\n\n\"A child.\"\n\nThe naked mite lay very still, the breath weakly fluttered. A somewhat\nnauseous gift, the girl raised her arms and received it gently, without\nhaste,--the saffron body appearing yet more squalid against the\nPalladian whiteness of her tunic, plain and cool as drapery in marble.\n\n\"It may live,\" she said. \"We'll do what we can.\" And followed by the\nblack-trousered woman, she moved quickly away to offer battle with\ndeath. A plain, usual fact, it seemed, involving no more surprise than\nrepugnance. Her face had hardly altered; and yet Rudolph, for the first\ntime in many days, had caught the fleeting brightness of compassion.\nMere light of the eyes, a half-imagined glory, incongruous in the sharp\nsmell of antiseptics, it left him wondering in the cloister. He knew now\nwhat had been missing by the river. \"I was naked, and\"--how ran the\nlines? He turned to go, recalling in a whirl snatches of truth he had\nnever known since boyhood, never seen away from home.\n\nAcross a court the padre hailed him,--a tall, ungainly patriarch under\nan enormous mushroom helmet of solar pith,--and walking along beside,\nlistened shrewdly to his narrative. They paused at the outer gate. The\npadre, nodding, frowning slightly, stood at ease, all angles and loose\njoints, as if relaxed by the growing heat.\n\nSuddenly he stood erect as a grenadier.\n\n\"That lie again!\" he cried. \"Listen!\"\n\nThe leper, without, harangued from his place apart, in a raucous voice\nfilled with the solitary pride of intellect.\n\n\"Well, men shall revile you,\" growled Dr. Earle. \"He says we steal\nchildren, to puncture their eyes for magic medicine!\"\n\nThen, heaving his wide shoulders,--\n\n\"Oh, well!\" he said wearily, \"thanks, anyhow. Come see us, when we're\nnot so busy? Good!--Look out these fellows don't fly at you.\"\n\nTired and befouled, Rudolph passed through into the torrid glare. The\nleper cut short his snarling oration. But without looking at him, the\nyoung man took the bridle from the coolie. There had been a test. He had\nseen a child, and two women. And yet it was with a pang he found that\nMrs. Forrester had not waited.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nTHE HOT NIGHT\n\nRudolph paced his long chamber like a wolf,--a wolf in summer, with too\nthick a coat. In sweat of body and heat of mind, he crossed from window\nto window, unable to halt.\n\nA faintly sour smell of parched things, oppressing the night without\nbreath or motion, was like an interminable presence, irritating,\npoisonous. The punkah, too, flapped incessant, and only made the lamp\ngutter. Broad leaves outside shone in mockery of snow; and like snow the\nstifled river lay in the moonlight, where the wet muzzles of buffaloes\nglistened, floating like knots on sunken logs, or the snouts of\ncrocodiles. Birds fluttered, sleepless and wretched. Coolies, flung\nasleep on the burnt grass, might have been corpses, but for the sound of\ntheir troubled breathing.\n\n\"If I could believe,\" he groaned, sitting with hands thrust through his\nhair. \"If I believe in her--But I came too late.\"\n\nThe lamp was an added torment. He sprang up from it, wiped the drops off\nhis forehead, and paced again. He came too late. All alone. The collar\nof his tunic strangled him. He stuffed his fingers underneath, and\nwrenched; then as he came and went, catching sight in a mirror, was\nshocked to see that, in Biblical fashion, he had rent his garments.\n\n\"This is bad,\" he thought, staring. \"It is the heat. I must not stay\nalone.\"\n\nHe shouted, clapped his hands for a servant, and at last, snatching a\ncoat from his unruffled boy, hurried away through stillness and\nmoonlight to the detested club. On the stairs a song greeted him,--a\nfragment with more breath than melody, in a raw bass:--\n\n\n\"Jolly boating weather,\nAnd a hay harvest breeze!\"\n\n\n\"Shut up!\" snarled another voice. \"Good God, man!\"\n\nThe loft was like a cave heated by subterranean fires. Two long punkahs\nflapped languidly in the darkness, with a whine of pulleys. Under a\nswinging lamp, in a pool of light and heat, four men sat playing cards,\ntheir tousled heads, bare arms, and cinglets torn open across the chest,\ngiving them the air of desperadoes.\n\n\"Jolly boating weather,\" wheezed the fat Sturgeon. He stood apart in\nshadow, swaying on his feet. \"What would you give,\" he propounded\nthickly, \"for a hay harvest breeze?\"\n\nHe climbed, or rolled, upon the billiard-table, turned head toward\npunkah, and suddenly lay still,--a gross white figure, collapsed and\nsprawling.\n\n\"How much does he think a man can stand?\" snapped Nesbit, his lean\nCockney face pulled in savage lines. \"Beast of a song! He'll die\nto-night, drinking.\"\n\n\"Die yourself,\" mumbled the singer, \"'m goin' sleep. More 'n you can\ndo.\"\n\nA groan from the players, and the vicious flip of a card, acknowledged\nthe hit. Rudolph joined them, ungreeting and ungreeted. The game went on\ngrimly, with now and then the tinkle of ice, or the popping of soda\nbottles. Sharp cords and flaccid folds in Wutzler's neck, Chantel's\nbrown cheeks, the point of Heywood's resolute chin, shone wet and\npolished in the lamplight. All four men scowled pugnaciously, even the\npale Nesbit, who was winning. Bad temper filled the air, as palpable as\nthe heat and stink of the burning oil.\n\nOnly Heywood maintained a febrile gayety, interrupting the game\nperversely, stirring old Wutzler to incoherent speech.\n\n\"What's that about Rome?\" he asked. \"You were saying?\"\n\n\"Rome is safed!\" cried the outcast, with sudden enthusiasm. \"In your\npaper _Tit-bit_, I read. How dey climb der walls op, yes, but Rome is\nsafed by a flook of geeze. Gracious me, der History iss great sopjeck!\nI lern moch.--But iss Rome yet a fortify town?\"\n\nChantel rapped out a Parisian oath.\n\n\"Do we play cards,\" he cried sourly, \"or listen to the chatter of\nsenility?\"\n\nHeywood held to the previous question.\n\n\"No, Wutz, that town's no longer fortified,\" he answered slowly. \"Geese\nlive there, still, as in--many other places.\"\n\nDr. Chantel examined his finger-tips as though for some defect; then,\nsnatching up the cards, shuffled and dealt with intense precision. The\ngame went on as before.\n\n\"I read alzo,\" stammered Wutzler, like a timid scholar encouraged to\nlecture, \"I read zo how your Englishman, Rawf Ralli, he spreadt der fine\nclock for your Queen, and lern your Queen smoking, no?\" He mopped his\nlean throat with the back of his hand. \"In Bengal are dere Rallis. Dey\nhandle jute.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" Heywood smiled a weary indulgence. Next instant he whirled on\nRudolph in fury.--\"Is this a game, or Idiot's Joy?\"\n\n\"I'm playing my best,\" explained Rudolph, sulkily.\n\n\"Then your best is the worst I ever saw! Better learn, before sitting\nin!\"\n\nChantel laughed, without merriment; Rudolph flung down his cards,\nstalked to the window, and stood looking out, in lonely, impotent rage.\nA long time passed, marked by alarming snores from the billiard-table.\nThe half-naked watchers played on, in ferocious silence. The night wore\nalong without relief.\n\nHours might have lapsed, when Dr. Chantel broke out as though the talk\nhad but paused a moment.\n\n\"So it goes!\" he sneered. \"Fools will always sit in, when they do not\nknow. They rush into the water, also, and play the hero!\"\n\nAgain his laughter was brief but malignant. Heywood had left his cards,\nrisen, and crossing the room, stood looking over Rudolph's shoulder into\nthe snowy moonlight. On the shoulder his hand rested, as by accident.\n\n\"It's the heat, old chap,\" he said wearily. \"Don't mind what we say\nto-night.\"\n\nRudolph made no sign, except to move from under his hand, so that, with\ntheir quarrel between them, the two men stared out across the blanched\nroofs and drooping trees, where long black shadows at last crept\ntoward the dawn.\n\n\"These heroes!\" continued the mocker. \"What is danger? Pouf--nothing!\nThey make it for the rest of us, so easily! Do you know,\" his voice rose\nand quickened, \"do you know, the other end of town is in an uproar? We\nmurder children, it appears, for medicine!\"\n\nRudolph started, turned, but now sat quiet under Heywood's grasp.\nChantel, in the lamplight, watched the punkahs with a hateful smile.\n\n\"The Gascons are not all dead,\" he murmured. \"They plunge us all into a\nturmoil, for the sake of a woman.\" He made a sudden startling gesture,\nlike a man who has lost control. \"For the sake,\" he cried angrily, \"of a\nperson we all know! Oh! we all know her! She is nothing more--\"\n\nThere was a light scuffle at the window.\n\n\"Dr. Chantel,\" began Heywood, with a sharp and dangerous courtesy, \"we\nare all unlike ourselves to-night. I am hardly the person to remind you,\nbut this club is hardly the place--\"\n\n\"Oh, la la!\" The other snapped his fingers, and reverting to his native\ntongue, finished his sentence wildly.\n\n\"You cad!\" Heywood advanced in long strides deliberately, as if\ngathering momentum for a collision. Before his blow could fall, he was\nsent spinning. Rudolph, his cheeks on fire, darted past and dealt, full\nforce, a clumsy backhand sweep of the arm. Light and quick as a leopard,\nChantel was on foot, erect, and even while his chair crashed on the\nfloor, had whipped out a handkerchief.\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Heywood,\" he said, stanching his lips, in icy\ncomposure. His eyes held an odd gleam of satisfaction. \"You are right.\nWe are not like ourselves, at present. I will better ask Mr. Sturgeon to\nsee your friend to-morrow morning. This morning, rather.\"\n\nNot without dignity, he turned, stepped quickly to the stairs, saluted\ngravely, and went down.\n\n\"No, no!\" panted Nesbit, wrestling with Rudolph. \"Easy on, now! Let you\ngo? No fear!\"\n\nHeywood wrenched the captive loose, but only to shake him violently, and\nthrust him into a chair.\n\n\"Be quiet, you little ass!\" he scolded. \"I've a great mind, myself, to\nrun after the bounder and kick him. But that sort of thing--you did\nenough. Who'd have thought? You young spitfire! Chantel took you on,\nexactly as he wanted.\"\n\nThe fat sleeper continued to snore. Wutzler came slinking back from his\nrefuge in the shadows.\n\n\"It iss zo badt!\" he whined, gulping nervously. \"It iss zo badt!\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" said Heywood. With arms folded, he eyed them sternly.\n\"It's bad. We might have known. If only I'd reached him first! By Jove,\nyou must let me fight that beast. Duels? The idiot, nobody fights duels\nany more. I've always--His cuffs are always dirty, too, on the inside!\"\n\nRudolph leaned back, like a man refreshed and comforted, but his laugh\nwas unsteady, and too boisterous.\n\n\"It is well,\" he bragged. \"Pistol-bullets--they fly on the wings of\nchance! No?--All is well.\"\n\n\"Pistols? My dear young gentleman,\" scoffed his friend, \"there's not a\npair of matched pistols in the settlement. And if there were, Chantel\nhas the choice. He'll take swords.\"\n\nHe paused, in a silence that grew somewhat menacing. From a slit in the\nwall the wheel of the punkah-thong whined insistently,--rise and fall,\nrise and fall of peevish complaint, distressing as a brain-fever bird.\n\n\"Swords, of course,\" continued Heywood. \"If only out of vanity.\nFencing,--oh, I hate the man, and the art's by-gone, if you like, but\nhe's a beautiful swordsman! Wonderful!\"\n\nRudolph still lay back, but now with a singular calm.\n\n\"It's just as well,\" he declared quietly.\n\nHeywood loosed a great breath, a sigh of vast relief.\n\n\"My word!\" he cried, grinning. \"So you're there, too, eh? You young\nSly-boots! If you're another expert--Bravo! We'll beat him at his own\ngame! Hoist with his own what-d'-ye-call-it! I'd give anything\"--He\nthumped the table, and pitched the cards broadcast, like an explosion of\nconfetti, in a little carnival of glee. \"You old Sly-boots!--But are you\nsure? He's quick as lightning.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" replied Rudolph, modestly. He trained his young\nmoustache upward with steady fingers, and sat very quiet, thinking long\nthoughts. A quaint smile played about his eyes.\n\n\"Good for you!\" said Heywood. \"Now let him come, as the Lord Mayor said\nof the hare. What sport! With an even chance--And what a load off\none's mind!\"\n\nHe moved away to the window, as though searching for air. Instead of\nmoonlight, without, there swam the blue mist of dawn.\n\n\"Not a word must ever reach old Gilly,\" he mused. \"Do you hear, Nesbit?\"\n\n\"If you think,\" retorted the clerk, stiffly, \"I don't know the proper\ncourse of be'aviour! Not likely!\"\n\nThe tall silhouette in the window made no reply, but stood grumbling\nprivately: \"A club! Yes, where we drink out of jam-pots--dead cushions,\ndead balls--no veranda--fellow that soils the inside of his cuffs first!\nWe're a pack of beach-combers.\"\n\nHe propped his elbows on the long sill, and leaned out, venting\nfragments of disgust. Then of a sudden he turned, and beckoned eagerly.\n\"Come here, you chaps. Look-see.\"\n\nThe others joined him. Gray vapors from river and paddy-field, lingering\nlike steam in a slow breeze, paled and dispersed in the growing light,\nas the new day, worse than the old, came sullenly without breath or\nrespite. A few twilight shapes were pattering through the narrow\nstreet--a squad of Yamen runners haling a prisoner.\n\n\"The Sword-Pen remains active,\" said Heywood, thoughtfully. \"That dingy\nlittle procession, do you know, it's quite theatrical? The Cross and the\nDragon. Eh? Another act's coming.\"\n\nEven Rudolph could spare a misgiving from his own difficulty while he\nwatched the prisoner. It was Chok Chung, the plump Christian merchant,\nslowly trudging toward the darkest of human courts, to answer for the\ndeath of the cormorant-fisher. The squad passed by. Rudolph saw again\nthe lighted shop, the tumbled figure retching on the floor; and with\nthese came a memory of that cold and scornful face, thinking so cruelly\namong the unthinking rabble. The Sword-Pen had written something in\nthe dark.\n\n\"I go find out\"; and Wutzler was away, as keen as a village gossip.\n\n\"Trouble's comin',\" Nesbit asserted glibly. \"There's politics afloat.\nBut I don't care.\" He stretched his arms, with a weary howl. \"That's the\nfirst yawn I've done to-night. Trouble keeps, worse luck. I'm off--seek\nmy downy.\"\n\nAlone with the grunting sleeper, the two friends sat for a long time and\nwatched the flooding daylight.\n\n\"What,\" began Rudolph, suddenly, and his voice trembled, \"what is your\ntrue opinion? You are so kind, and I was just a fool. That other day, I\nwould not listen. You laughed. Now tell me, so--as you were to die next.\nYou were joking? Can I truly be proud of--of her?\"\n\nHe leaned forward, white and eager, waiting for the truth like a dicer\nfor the final throw.\n\n\"Of yourself, dear old chap. Not of the lady. She's the fool, not you.\nPoor old Gilly Forrester slaves here to send her junketing in Japan,\nKashmir, Ceylon, Home. What Chantel said--well, between the two of us,\nI'm afraid he's right. It's a pity.\"\n\nHeywood paused, frowning.\n\n\"A pity, too, this quarrel. So precious few of us, and trouble ahead.\nThe natives lashing themselves into a state of mind, or being lashed.\nThe least spark--Rough work ahead, and here we are at swords' points.\"\n\n\"And the joke is,\" Rudolph added quietly, \"I do not know a sword's point\nfrom a handle.\"\n\nHeywood turned, glowered, and twice failed to speak.\n\n\"Rudie--old boy,\" he stammered, \"that man--Preposterous! Why, it's plain\nmurder!\"\n\nRudolph stared straight ahead, without hope, without illusions, facing\nthe haggard light of morning. A few weeks ago he might have wept; but\nnow his laugh, short and humorous, was worthy of his companion.\n\n\"I do not care, more,\" he answered. \"Luck, so called I it, when I\nescaped the militar' service. Ho ho! Luck, to pass into the _Ersatz!_--I\ndo not care, now. I cannot believe, even cannot I fight.\nWorthless--dreamer! My deserts. It's a good way out.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nPASSAGE AT ARMS\n\n\"Boy.\"\n\n\"Sai.\"\n\n\"S'pose Mr. Forrester bym-by come, you talkee he, master no got, you\nchin-chin he come-back.\"\n\n\"Can do.\"\n\nThe long-coated boy scuffed away, across the chunam floor, and\ndisappeared in the darkness. Heywood submitted his head once more to the\nnimble hands of his groom, who, with horse-clippers and a pair of\nenormous iron shears, was trimming the stubborn chestnut locks still\ncloser. The afternoon glow, reflected from the burnt grass and white\nwalls of the compound, struck upward in the vault-spaces of the ground\nfloor, and lighted oddly the keen-eyed yellow mafoo and his serious\nyoung master.\n\nNesbit, pert as a jockey, sat on the table swinging his feet furiously.\n\n\"Sturgeon would take it all right, of course,\" he said, with airy\nwisdom. \"Quite the gentleman, he is. Netch'rally. No fault of his.\"\n\n\"Not the least,\" Heywood assented gloomily. \"Did everything he could.\nIf I were commissioned to tell 'em outright--'The youngster can't\nfence'--why, we might save the day. But our man won't even listen to\nthat. Fight's the word. Chantel will see, on the spot, directly they\nface. But will that stop him? No fear: he's worked up to the pitch of\nkilling. He'll lunge first, and be surprised afterward.--So regrettable!\nSuch remorse!--Oh, I know _him!_\"\n\nThe Cockney fidgeted for a time. His face--the face of a street-bred\nurchin--slowly worked into lines of abnormal cunning.\n\n\"I say! I was thinking,\" he ventured at last. \"Two swords, that's all?\nJust so. Now--my boy used to be learn-pidgin at Chantel's. Knows that\n'ouse inside out--loafs there now, the beggar, with Chantel's cook. Why\nnot send him over--prowling, ye know--fingers the bric-a-brac, bloomin'\nass, and breaks a sword-blade. Perfectly netch'ral. 'Can secure, all\nplopah,' Accident, ye know. All off with their little duel. What?\"\n\nHeywood chuckled, and bowed his head to the horse-clippers.\n\n\"Last week,\" he replied. \"Not to-day. This afternoon's rather late for\naccidents. You make me feel like Pompey on his galley: 'This thou\nshouldst have done, and not have spoken on't,'--Besides, those swords\nbelonged to Chantel's father. He began as a gentleman.--But you're a\ngood sort, Nesbit, to take the affair this fashion.\"\n\nLost in smoke, the clerk grumbled that the gory affair was unmentionable\nnonsense.\n\n\"Quite,\" said Heywood. \"We've tried reasoning. No go. As you say, an\naccident. That's all can save the youngster now. Impossible, of course.\"\nHe sighed. Then suddenly the gray eyes lighted, became both shrewd and\ndistant; a malicious little smile stole about the corners of his mouth.\n\"Have-got! The credit's yours, Nesbit. Accident: can do. And this\none--by Jove, it won't leave either of 'em a leg to stand on!--Here,\nmafoo, makee finish!\"\n\nHe sprang up, clapped a helmet on the shorn head, and stalked out into\nthe sunlight.\n\n\"Come on,\" he called. \"It's nearly time. We must pick up our young\nHotspur.\"\n\nThe clerk followed, through the glowing compound and the road. In the\nshade of the nunnery gate they found Rudolph, who, raising his rattan,\nsaluted them with a pale and stoic gravity.\n\n\"Are we ready?\" he asked; and turning, took a slow, cool survey of the\nnunnery, as though looking his last--from the ditch at their feet to the\nred tiles, patched with bronze mould, that capped the walls and the\nroof. \"I never left any place with less regret. Come, let's go.\"\n\nThe three men had covered some ground before Rudolph broke the silence.\n\n\"You'll find a few little things up there in my strong-box, Maurice.\nSome are marked for you, and the rest--will you send them Home, please?\"\nHe hesitated. \"I hope neither of you will misunderstand me. I'm horribly\nafraid, but not--but only because this fellow will make me look absurd.\nIf I knew the first motion!\" He broke out angrily. \"I cannot bear to\nhave him laugh, also! I cannot bear!\"\n\nHeywood clapped him on the shoulder, and gave a queer cough.\n\n\"If that's all, never you fear! I'll teach you your guard. 'Once in a\nwhile we can finish in style.' Eh?--Rudie, you blooming German, I--I\nthink we must have been brothers! We'll pull it off yet.\"\n\nHeywood spoke with a strange alacrity, and tried again to cough. This\ntime, however, there was no mistake--he was laughing.\n\nRudolph shot at him one glance of startled unbelief, and then, tossing\nhis head, marched on without a word. Pride and loneliness overwhelmed\nhim. The two at his side were no companions--not even presences. He\nwent alone, conscious only of the long flood of sunset, and the black\ninterlacing pattern of bamboos. The one friendly spirit had deserted,\nlaughing; yet even this last and worst of earthly puzzles did not\nmatter. It was true, what he had read; this, which they called death,\nwas a lonely thing.\n\nOn a broken stone bench, Sturgeon, sober and dejected, with puffy\ncircles under his eyes, sat waiting. A long parcel, wrapped in green\nbaize, lay across his knees. He nodded gloomily, without rising. At his\nfeet wandered a path, rankly matted with burnt weeds, and bordered with\ngreen bottle-ends, the \"dimples\" choked with discs of mud. The place was\na deserted garden, where the ruins of a European house--burnt by natives\nin some obscure madness, years ago--sprawled in desolation among wild\nshrubs. A little way down the path stood Teppich and Chantel, each with\nhis back turned and his hands clasped, like a pair of sulky Napoleons,\none fat, one slender. The wooden pretense of their attitude set Rudolph,\nfor an instant, to laughing silently and bitterly. This final\nscene,--what justice, that it should be a mean waste, the wreck of silly\npleasure-grounds, long forgotten, and now used only by grotesque\nplay-actors. He must die, in both action and setting, without dignity.\nIt was some comfort, he became aware, to find that the place was fairly\nprivate. Except for the breach by which they had entered, the blotched\nand spotted compound walls stood ruinous yet high, shutting out all but\na rising slant of sunlight, and from some outpost line of shops, near\nby, the rattle of an abacus and the broken singsong of argument, now\nharsh, now drowsy.\n\nHeywood had been speaking earnestly to Sturgeon:--\n\n\"A little practice--try the balance of the swords. No more than fair.\"\n\n\"Fair? Most certainly,\" croaked that battered convivialist. \"Chantel\ncan't object.\"\n\nHe rose, and waddled down the path. Rudolph saw Chantel turn, frowning,\nthen nod and smile. The nod was courteous, the smile full of satire. The\nfat ambassador returned.\n\n\"Right-oh,\" he puffed, tugging from the baize cover a shining pair of\nbell-hilted swords. \"Here, try 'em out.\" His puffy eyes turned furtively\ntoward Rudolph. \"May be bad form, Hackh, but--we all wish you luck, I\nfancy.\" Then, in a burst of candor, \"Wish that unspeakable ass felt as\nseedy as I do--heat-stroke--drop dead--that sort of thing.\"\n\nStill grumbling treason, this strange second rejoined his principal.\n\n\"Jackets off,\" commanded Heywood; and in their cinglets, each with sword\nunder arm, the two friends took shelter behind a ragged clump of\nplantains. The yellow leaves, half dead with drought and blight, hung\nponderous as torn strips of sheet metal in the lifeless air.\n\nBehind this tattered screen, Rudolph studied, for a moment, the lethal\nobject in his hand. It was very graceful,--the tapering, three-cornered\nblade, with shallow grooves in which blood was soon to run, the silver\nhilt where his enemy's father had set, in florid letters, the name of\n\"H.B. St. A. Chantel,\" and a date. How long ago, he thought, the steel\nwas forged for this day.\n\n\"It is Fate.\" He looked up sadly. \"Come, show me how to begin; so that I\ncan stand up to him.\"\n\n\"Here, then.\" Slowly, easily, his long limbs transformed with a sudden\nyouthful grace, Heywood moved through the seven positions of On\nGuard. \"Try it.\"\n\nRudolph learned only that his own clumsy imitation was hopeless.\n\n\"Once more.--He can't see us.\"\n\nAgain and again, more and more rapidly, they performed the motions of\nthis odd rehearsal. Suddenly Heywood stepped back, and lowering his\npoint, looked into his pupil's face, long and earnestly.\n\n\"For the last time,\" he said: \"won't you let me tell him? This is\nextremely silly.\"\n\nRudolph hung his head, like a stubborn child.\n\n\"Do you still think,\" he answered coldly, \"that I would beg off?\"\n\nWith a hopeless gesture of impatience, Heywood stepped forward briskly.\n\"Very well, then. Once more.\" And as their blades clashed softly\ntogether, a quick light danced in his eyes. \"Here's how our friend will\nstick you!\" His point cut a swift little circle, and sped home. By a\nwild instinct, the novice beat it awkwardly aside. His friend laughed,\npoised again, disengaged again, but in mid-career of this heartless\nplay, stumbled and came pitching forward. Rudolph darted back, swept his\narm blindly, and cried out; for with the full impetus of the mishap, a\nshock had run from wrist to elbow. He dropped his sword, and in\nstupefaction watched the red blood coursing down his forearm, and his\nthird finger twitching convulsively, beyond control.\n\n\"Dear fellow!\" cried his opponent, scrambling upright. \"So sorry! I say,\nthat's a bad one.\" With a stick and a handkerchief, he twisted on a\ntourniquet, muttering condolence: \"Pain much? Lost my balance, you know.\nThat better?--What a clumsy accident!\" Then, dodging out from the\nplantain screen, and beckoning,--\"All you chaps! Come over here!\"\n\nNesbit came running, but at sight of the bloody victim, pulled up short.\n\"What ho!\" he whispered, first with a stare, then a grin of mysterious\njoy. Sturgeon gave a sympathetic whistle, and stolidly unwound bandages.\nAt first the two Napoleons remained aloof, but at last, yielding to\nindignant shouts, haughtily approached. The little group stood at fault.\n\nHeywood wiped his sword-blade very carefully on a plantain leaf; then\nstood erect, to address them with a kind of cool severity.\n\n\"I regret this more than anybody,\" he declared, pausing, and picking his\nwords. \"We were at practice, and my friend had the misfortune to be run\nthrough the arm.\"\n\nChantel flung out his hands, in a motion at once furious and impudent.\n\n\"Zut! What a farce!--Will you tell me, please, since your friend has\ndisabled himself\"--\n\nHeywood wheeled upon him, scornfully.\n\n\"You have no right to such an expression,\" he stated, with a coldness\nwhich conveyed more rage than the other man's heat. \"This was entirely\nmy fault. It's I who have spoiled your--arrangement, and therefore I am\nquite ready to take up my friend's quarrel.\"\n\n\"I have no quarrel with you,\" replied Chantel, contemptuously. \"You saw\nlast night how he--\"\n\n\"He was quicker than I, that's all. By every circumstance, I'm the\nnatural proxy. Besides\"--the young man appealed to the company,\nsmiling--\"besides, what a pity to postpone matters, and spoil the\noccasion, when Doctor Chantel has gone to the trouble of a clean shirt.\"\n\nThe doctor recoiled, flung up a trembling arm, and as quickly dropped\nit. His handsome face burned darker, then faded with a mortal pallor,\nand for one rigid moment, took on such a strange beauty as though it\nwere about to be translated into bronze. His brown fingers twitched,\nbecame all nerves and sinews and white knuckles. Then, stepping\nbackward, he withdrew from the circle.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said lightly. \"Since we are all so--irregular. I will\ntake the substitute.\"\n\nRudolph gave a choking cry, and would have come forward; but Sturgeon\nclung to the wounded arm, and bound on his bandage.\n\n\"Hold still, there!\" he scolded, as though addressing a horse; then\ngrowled in Heywood's ear, \"Why did _you_ go lose your temper?\"\n\n\"Didn't. We can't let him walk over us, though.\" The young man held the\nsword across his throat, and whispered, \"Only angry up to here!\"\n\nAnd indeed, through the anxious preliminary silence, he stood waiting as\ncool and ready as a young centurion.\n\nHis adversary, turning back the sleeves of the unfortunate white linen,\npicked up the other sword, and practiced his fingering on the silver\nhilt, while the blade answered as delicately as the bow to a violinist.\nAt last he came forward, with thin lips and hard, thoughtful eyes, like\na man bent upon dispatch. Both men saluted formally, and sprang\non guard.\n\nFrom the first twitter of the blades, even Rudolph knew the outcome.\nHeywood, his face white and anxious in the failing light, fought at full\nstretch, at the last wrench of skill. Chantel, for the moment, was\nfencing; and though his attacks came ceaseless and quick as flame, he\nwas plainly prolonging them, discarding them, repeating, varying,\nwhether for black-hearted merriment, or the vanity of perfect form, or\nlove of his art. Graceful, safe, easy, as though performing the grand\nsalute, he teased and frolicked, his bright blade puzzling the sight,\nscattering like quicksilver in the endless whirl and clash.\n\nTeppich was gaping foolishly, Sturgeon shaking his head, the Cockney,\nwith narrow body drawn together, watching, shivering, squatting on toes\nand finger-tips, like a runner about to spring from a mark. Rudolph,\ndizzy with pain and suspense, nursed his forearm mechanically. The\nhurried, silver ring of the hilts dismayed him, the dust from the garden\npath choked him like an acrid smoke.\n\nSuddenly Chantel, dropping low like a deflected arrow, swooped in with\nfingers touching the ground. On \"three feet,\" he had delivered the blow\nso long withheld.\n\nThe watchers shouted. Nesbit sprang up, released. But Heywood, by some\ndesperate sleight, had parried the certainty, and even tried a riposte.\nStill afoot and fighting, he complained testily above the sword-play:--\n\n\"Don't shout like that! Fair field, you chaps!\"\n\nAbove the sword-play, too, came gradually a murmur of voices. Through\nthe dust, beyond the lunging figures, Rudolph was distantly aware of\ncrowded bodies, of yellow faces grinning or agape, in the breach of the\ncompound wall. Men of the neighboring hamlet had gathered, to watch the\nforeign monsters play at this new, fantastic game. Shaven heads bobbed,\nsaffron arms pointed, voices, sharp and guttural, argued scornfully.\n\nThe hilts rang, the blades grated faster. But now it was plain that\nHeywood could do no more, by luck or inspiration. Fretted by his clumsy\nyet strong and close defense, Chantel was forcing on the end. He gave a\npanting laugh. Instantly, all saw the weaker blade fly wide, the\nstronger swerve, to dart in victorious,--and then saw Doctor Chantel\nstaggering backward, struck full in the face by something round and\nheavy. The brown missile skipped along the garden path.\n\nAnother struck a bottle-end, and burst into milk-white fragments, like a\nbomb. A third, rebounding from Teppich's girdle, left him bent and\ngasping. Strange yells broke out, as from a tribe of apes. The air was\nthick with hurtling globes. Cocoanuts rained upon the company,\ntempestuously, as though an invisible palm were shaken by a hurricane.\nAmong them flew sticks, jagged lumps of sun-dried clay, thick scales\nof plaster.\n\n\"Aow!\" cried Nesbit, \"the bloomin' coolies!\" First to recover, he\nskipped about, fielding and hurling back cocoanuts.\n\nA small but raging phalanx crowded the gap in the wall, throwing\ncontinually, howling, and exhorting one another to rush in.\n\n\"A riot!\" cried Heywood, and started, sword in hand. \"Come on, stop\n'em!\"\n\nBut it was Nesbit who, wrenching a pair of loose bottles from the path,\nbrandishing them aloft like clubs, and shouting the unseemly\nbattle-cries of a street-fighter, led the white men into this deadly\nbreach. At the first shock, the rioters broke and scattered, fled round\ncorners of the wall, crashed through bamboos, went leaping across\npaddy-fields toward the river. The tumult--except for lonely howls in\nthe distance--ended as quickly as it had risen. The little band of\nEuropeans returned from the pursuit, drenched with sweat, panting, like\na squad of triumphant football players; but no one smiled.\n\n\"That explains it,\" grumbled Heywood. He pointed along the path to\nwhere, far off, a tall, stooping figure paced slowly toward the town,\nhis long robe a moving strip of color, faint in the twilight. \"The\nSword-Pen dropped some remarks in passing.\"\n\nThe others nodded moodily, too breathless for reply. Nesbit's forehead\nbore an ugly cut, Rudolph's bandage was red and sopping. Chantel, more\nrueful than either, stared down at a bleeding hand, which held two\nshards of steel. He had fallen, and snapped his sword in the rubble of\nold masonry.\n\n\"No more blades,\" he said, like a child with a broken toy; \"there are no\nmore blades this side of Saigon.\"\n\n\"Then we must postpone.\" Heywood mopped his dripping and fiery cheeks.\nHe tossed a piece of silver to one who wailed in the ditch,--a forlorn\nstranger from Hai-nan, lamenting the broken shells and empty baskets of\nhis small venture.--\"Contribution, you chaps. A bad day for imported\ncocoanuts. Wish I carried some money: this chit system is\ndamnable.--Meanwhile, doctor, won't you forget anything I was rude\nenough to say? And come join me in a peg at the club? The heat is\nexcessive.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nTHREE PORTALS\n\nNot till after dinner, that evening, did Rudolph rouse from his stupor.\nWith the clerk, he lay wearily in the upper chamber of Heywood's house.\nThe host, with both his long legs out at window, sat watching the smoky\nlights along the river, and now and then cursing the heat.\n\n\"After all,\" he broke silence, \"those cocoanuts came time enough.\"\n\n\"Didn't they just?\" said Nesbit, jauntily; and fingering the plaster\ncross on his wounded forehead, drawled: \"You might think I'd done a bit\no' dueling myself, by the looks.--But I had _some_ part. Now, that\naccident trick. Rather neat, what? But for me, you might never have\nthought o' that--\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" snapped Heywood, and pulling in his legs, rose and stamped\nacross the room.\n\nA glass of ice and tansan smashed on the floor. Rudolph was on foot,\nclutching his bandaged arm as though the hurt were new.\n\n\"You!\" he stammered. \"You did that!\" He stood gaping, thunderstruck.\n\nFelt soles scuffed in the darkness, and through the door, his yellow\nface wearing a placid and lofty grin, entered Ah Pat, the compradore.\n\n\"One coolie-man hab-got chit.\"\n\nHe handed a note to his master, who snatched it as though glad of the\ninterruption, bent under the lamp, and scowled.\n\nThe writing was in a crabbed, antique German character:--\n\n\"Please to see bearer, in bad clothes but urgent. We are all in danger.\n_Um Gottes willen_--\" It straggled off, illegible. The signature, \"Otto\nWutzler,\" ran frantically into a blot.\n\n\"Can do,\" said Heywood. \"You talkee he, come topside.\"\n\nThe messenger must have been waiting, however, at the stairhead; for no\nsooner had the compradore withdrawn, than a singular little coolie\nshuffled into the room. Lean and shriveled as an opium-smoker, he wore\nloose clothes of dirty blue,--one trousers-leg rolled up. The brown\nface, thin and comically small, wore a mask of inky shadow under a\nwicker bowl hat. His eyes were cast down in a strange fashion, unlike\nthe bold, inquisitive peering of his countrymen,--the more strange, in\nthat he spoke harshly and abruptly, like a racer catching breath.\n\n\"I bring news.\" His dialect was the vilest and surliest form of the\ncolloquial \"Clear Speech.\"--\"One pair of ears, enough.\"\n\n\"You can speak and act more civilly,\" retorted Heywood, \"or taste the\nbamboo.\"\n\nThe man did not answer, or look up, or remove his varnished hat. Still\ndowncast and hang-dog, he sidled along the verge of the shadow, snatched\nfrom the table the paper and a pencil, and choosing the darkest part of\nthe wall, began to write. The lamp stood between him and the company:\nHeywood alone saw--and with a shock of amazement--that he did not print\nvertically as with a brush, but scrawled horizontally. He tossed back\nthe paper, and dodged once more into the gloom.\n\nThe postscript ran in the same shaky hand:--\n\n\"Send way the others both.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the young master of the house; and then over his shoulder,\n\"Excuse us a moment--me, I should say.\"\n\nHe led the dwarfish coolie across the landing, to the deserted\ndinner-table. The creature darted past him, blew out one candle, and\nthrust the other behind a bottle, so that he stood in a wedge of shadow.\n\n\"Eng-lish speak I ver' badt,\" he whispered; and then with something\nbetween gasp and chuckle, \"but der _pak-wa_ goot, no? When der live\ndependt, zo can mann--\" He caught his breath, and trembled in a\nstrong seizure.\n\n\"Good?\" whispered Heywood, staring. \"Why, man, it's wonderful! You\n_are_ a coolie\"--Wutzler's conical wicker-hat ducked as from a blow. \"I\nbeg your pardon. I mean, you're--\"\n\nThe shrunken figure pulled itself together.\n\n\"You are right,\" he whispered, in the vernacular. \"To-night I am a\ncoolie--all but the eyes. Therefore this hat.\"\n\nHeywood stepped back to the door, and popped his head out. The dim hall\nwas empty.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said, returning. \"What is your news?\"\n\n\"Riots. They are coming. We are all marked for massacre. All day I ran\nabout the town, finding out. The trial of Chok Chung, your--_our_\nChristian merchant--I saw him 'cross the hall.' They kept asking, 'Do\nyou follow the foreign dogs and goats?' But he would only answer, 'I\nfollow the Lord Jesus.' So then they beat out his teeth with a heavy\nshoe, and cast him into prison. Now they wait, to see if his padre will\ninterfere with the law. It is a trap. The suit is certainly brought by\nFang the scholar, whom they call the Sword-Pen.\"\n\n\"That much,\" said Heywood, \"I could have told you.\"\n\nWutzler glanced behind him fearfully, as though the flickering shadows\nmight hear.\n\n\"But there is more. Since dark I ran everywhere, watching, listening to\ngossip. I painted my skin with mangrove-bark water. You know this\nsign?\" He patted his right leg, where the roll of trousers bound his\nthigh. \"It is for protection in the streets. It says, 'I am a\nHeaven-and-Earth man.'\"\n\n\"The Triad!\" Heywood whistled. \"You?\"\n\nThe other faltered, and hung his head.\n\n\"Yes,\" he whispered at last. \"My--my wife's cousin, he is a Grass\nSandal. He taught her the verses at home, for safety.--We mean no harm,\nnow, we of the Triad. But there is another secret band, having many of\nour signs. It is said they ape our ritual. Fang the scholar heads their\nlodge. They are the White Lotus.\"\n\n\"White Lotus?\" Heywood snapped his fingers. \"Nonsense. Extinct, this\nhundred years.\"\n\n\"Extinct? They meet to-night,\" said the outcast, in sudden grief and\npassion. \"They drink blood--plan blood. Extinct? Are _you_ married to\nthese people? Does the knowledge come so cheap, or at a price? All these\nyears--darkness--sunken--alone\"--He trembled violently, but regained his\nvoice. \"O my friend! This very night they swear in recruits, and set the\nday. I know their lodge-room. For any sake, believe me! I know!\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Heywood, curtly. \"I believe you. But why come here? Why\nnot stay, and learn more?\"\n\nWutzler's head dropped on his breast again. The varnished hat gleamed\nsoftly in the darkness.\n\n\"I--I dare not stay,\" he sobbed.\n\n\"Oh, exactly!\" Heywood flung out an impatient arm. \"The date, man! The\nday they set. You came away without it!--We sit tight, then, and wait in\nignorance.\"\n\nThe droll, withered face, suddenly raised, shone with great tears that\nstreaked the mangrove stain.\n\n\"My head sits loosely already, with what I have done to-night. I found a\nlistening place--next door: a long roof. You can hear and see them--But\nI could not stay. Yes, I am a coward.\"\n\n\"There, there!\" Heywood patted his shoulder. \"I didn't mean--Here, have\na drink.\"\n\nThe man drained the tumbler at a gulp; stood without a word, sniffing\nmiserably; then of a sudden, as though the draught had worked, looked up\nbold and shrewd.\n\n\"Do you?\" he whispered. \"Do _you_ dare go to the place I show you, and\nhide? You would learn.\"\n\nHeywood started visibly, paused, then laughed.\n\n\"Excellent,\" he said. \"_Tu quoque_ is good argument. Can you smuggle\nme?--Then come on.\" He stepped lightly across the landing, and called\nout, \"You chaps make yourselves at home, will you? Business, you know.\nWhat a bore! I'll not be back till late.\" And as he followed the\nslinking form downstairs, he grumbled, \"If at all, perhaps.\"\n\nThe moon still lurked behind the ocean, making an aqueous pallor above\nthe crouching roofs. The two men hurried along a \"goat\" path, skirted\nthe town wall, and stole through a dark gate into a darker maze of\nlonely streets. Drawing nearer to a faint clash of cymbals in some\njoss-house, they halted before a blind wall.\n\n\"In the first room,\" whispered the guide, \"a circle is drawn on the\nfloor. Put your right foot there, and say, 'We are all in-the-circle\nmen,' If they ask, remember: you go to pluck the White Lotus. These men\nhate it, they are Triad brothers, they will let you pass. You come from\nthe East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls; you studied in the\nRed Flower Pavilion; your eyes are bloodshot because\"--He lectured\nearnestly, repeating desperate nonsense, over and over. \"No: not so. Say\nit exactly, after me.\"\n\nThey held a hurried catechism in the dark.\n\n\"There,\" sighed Wutzler, at last, \"that is as much as we can hope. Do\nnot forget. They will pass you through hidden ways.--But you are very\nrash. It is not too late to go home.\"\n\nReceiving no answer, he sighed more heavily, and gave a complicated\nknock. Bars clattered within, and a strip of dim light widened. \"Who\ncomes?\" said a harsh but guarded voice, with a strong Hakka brogue.\n\n\"A brother,\" answered the outcast, \"to pluck the White Lotus. Aid,\nbrothers.--Go in, I can help no further. If you are caught, slide down,\nand run westward to the gate which is called the Meeting of\nthe Dragons.\"\n\nHeywood nodded, and slipped in. Beside a leaf-point flame of peanut-oil,\na broad, squat giant sat stiff and still against the opposite wall, and\nstared with cruel, unblinking eyes. If the stranger were the first white\nman to enter, this motionless grim janitor gave no sign. On the earthen\nfloor lay a small circle of white lime. Heywood placed his right foot\ninside it.\n\n\"We are all in-the-circle men.\"\n\n\"Pass,\" said the guard.\n\nOut from shadow glided a tall native with a halberd, who opened a door\nin the far corner.\n\nIn the second room, dim as the first, burned the same smoky orange light\non the same table. But here a twisted <DW36>, his nose long and\npendulous with elephantiasis, presided over three cups of tea set in a\nrow. Heywood lifted the central cup, and drank.\n\n\"Will you bite the clouds?\" asked the second guard, in a soft and husky\nbass. As he spoke, the great nose trembled slightly.\n\n\"No, I will bite ginger,\" replied the white man.\n\n\"Why is your face so green?\"\n\n\"It is a melon-face--a green face with a red heart.\"\n\n\"Pass,\" said the <DW36>, gently. He pulled a cord--the nose quaking\nwith this exertion--and opened the third door.\n\nAgain the chamber was dim. A venerable man in gleaming silks--a\ngrandfather, by his drooping rat-tail moustaches--sat fanning himself.\nIn the breath of his black fan, the lamplight tossed queer shadows\nleaping, and danced on the table of polished camagon. Except for this\nunrest, the aged face might have been carved from yellow soapstone. But\nhis slant eyes were the sharpest yet.\n\n\"You have come far,\" he said, with sinister and warning courtesy.\n\nToo far, thought Heywood, in a sinking heart; but answered:--\n\n\"From the East, where the Fusang cocks spit orient pearls.\"\n\n\"And where did you study?\" The black fan stopped fluttering.\n\n\"In the Red Flower Pavilion.\"\n\n\"What book did you read?\"\n\n\"The book,\" said Heywood, holding his wits by his will, \"the book was\nTen Thousand Thousand Pages.\"\n\n\"And the theme?\"\n\n\"The waters of the deluge crosswise flow.\" \"And what\"--the aged voice\nrose briskly--\"what saw you on the waters?\"\n\n\"The Eight Abbots, floating,\" answered Heywood, negligently.--\"But,\" ran\nhis thought, \"he'll pump me dry.\"\n\n\"Why,\" continued the examiner, \"do you look so happy?\"\n\n\"Because Heaven has sent the Unicorn.\"\n\nThe black fan began fluttering once more. It seemed a hopeful sign; but\nthe keen old eyes were far from satisfied.\n\n\"Why have you such a sensual face?\"\n\n\"I was born under a peach tree.\"\n\n\"Pass,\" said the old man, regretfully. And Heywood, glancing back from\nthe mouth of a dark corridor, saw him, beside the table of camagon,\nwagging his head like a judge doubtful of his judgment.\n\nThe narrow passage, hot, fetid, and blacker than the wholesome night\nwithout, crooked about sharp corners, that bruised the wanderer's hands\nand arms. Suddenly he fell down a short flight of slimy steps, landing\nin noisome mud at the bottom of some crypt. A trap, a suffocating well,\nhe thought; and rose filthy, choked with bitterness and disgust. Only\nthe taunting justice of Wutzler's argument, the retort _ad hominem_, had\nsent him headlong into this dangerous folly. He had scolded a coward\nwith hasty words, and been forced to follow where they led. To this\nloathsome hole. Behind him, a door closed, a bar scraped softly into\nplace. Before him, as he groped in rage and self-reproach, rose a vault\nof solid plaster, narrow as a chimney.\n\nBut presently, glancing upward, he saw a small cluster of stars\nblinking, voluptuous, immeasurably overhead. Their pittance of light, as\nhis eyesight cleared, showed a ladder rising flat against the wall. He\nreached up, grasped the bamboo rungs, hoisted with an acrobatic wrench,\nand began to climb cautiously.\n\nAbove, faint and muffled, sounded a murmur of voices.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nWHITE LOTUS\n\nHe was swarming up, quiet as a thief, when his fingers clawed the bare\nplaster. The ladder hung from the square end of a protruding beam, above\nwhich there were no more rungs. He hung in doubt.\n\nThen, to his great relief, something blacker than the starlight gathered\ninto form over his head,--a slanting bulk, which gradually took on a\nfamiliar meaning. He chuckled, reached for it, and fingering the rough\nedge to avoid loose tiles, hauled himself up to a foothold on the beam,\nand so, flinging out his arms and hooking one knee, scrambled over and\nlay on a ribbed and mossy surface, under the friendly stars. The outcast\nand his strange brethren had played fair: this was the long roof, and\nclose ahead rose the wall of some higher building, an upright blackness\nfrom which escaped two bits of light,--a right angle of hairbreadth\nlines, and below this a brighter patch, small and ragged. Here, louder,\nbut confused with a gentle scuffing of feet, sounded the voices of the\nrival lodge.\n\nToward these he crawled, stopping at every creak of the tiles. Once a\nbroken roll snapped off, and slid rattling down the roof. He sat up,\nevery muscle ready for the sudden leap and shove that would send him\nsliding after it into the lower darkness. It fell but a short distance,\ninto something soft. Gradually he relaxed, but lay very still. Nothing\nfollowed; no one had heard.\n\nHe tried again, crawled forward his own length, and brought up snug and\nsafe in the angle where roof met wall. The voices and shuffling feet\nwere dangerously close. He sat up, caught a shaft of light full in his\nface, and peered in through the ragged chink. Two legs in bright,\nwrinkled hose, and a pair of black shoes with thick white soles, blocked\nthe view. For a long time they shifted, uneasy and tantalizing. He could\nhear only a hubbub of talk,--random phrases without meaning. The legs\nmoved away, and left a clear space.\n\nBut at the same instant, a grating noise startled him, directly\noverhead, out of doors. The thin right angle of light spread instantly\ninto a brilliant square. With a bang, a wooden shutter slid open.\nHeywood lay back swiftly, just as a long, fat bamboo pipe, two sleeves,\nand the head of a man in a red silk cap were thrust out into the\nnight air.\n\n\"_Ai-yah!\"_ sighed the man, and puffed at his bamboo. \"It is hot.\"\n\nHeywood tried to blot himself against the wall. The lounger, propped on\nelbows, finished his smoke, spat upon the tiles, and remained, a pensive\nsilhouette.\n\n\"_Ai-yah!\"_ he sighed again; then knocking out the bamboo, drew in his\nhead. Not until the shutter slammed, did Heywood shake the burning\nsparks from his wrist.\n\nIn the same movement, however, he raised head and shoulders to spy\nthrough the chink. This time the bright-hosed legs were gone. He saw\nclear down a brilliant lane of robes and banners, multicolored, and\nshining with embroidery and tinsel,--a lane between two ranks of crowded\nmen, who, splendid with green and blue and yellow robes of ceremony,\nfaced each other in a strong lamplight, that glistened on their oily\ncheeks. The chatter had ceased. Under the crowded rows of shaven\nforeheads, their eyes blinked, deep-set and expectant. At the far end of\nthe loft, through two circular arches or giant hoops of rattan, Heywood\nat last descried a third arch, of swords; beyond this, a tall incense\njar smouldering gray wisps of smoke, beside a transverse table twinkling\nwith candles like an altar; and over these, a black image with a pale,\ncarved face, seated bolt upright before a lofty, intricate, gilded\nshrine of the Patriot War-God.\n\nA tall man in dove-gray silk with a high scarlet turban moved athwart\nthe altar, chanting as he solemnly lifted one by one a row of symbols: a\nround wooden measure, heaped with something white, like rice, in which\nstuck a gay cluster of paper flags; a brown, polished abacus; a mace\ncarved with a dragon, another carved with a phoenix; a rainbow robe,\ngleaming with the plumage of Siamese kingfishers. All these, and more,\nhe displayed aloft and replaced among the candles.\n\nWhen his chant ended, a brisk little man in yellow stepped forward into\nthe lane.\n\n\"O Fragrant Ones,\" he shrilled, \"I bring ten thousand recruits, to join\nour army and swear brotherhood. Attend, O Master of Incense.\"\n\nBehind him, a squad of some dozen barefoot wretches, in coolie clothes,\nwith queues un-plaited, crawled on all fours through the first arch.\nThey crouched abject, while the tall Master of Incense in the dove-gray\nsilk sternly examined their sponsor.\n\nIn the outer darkness, Heywood craned and listened till neck and\nshoulders ached. He could make nothing of the florid verbiage.\n\nWith endless ritual, the crawling novices reached the arch of swords.\nThey knelt, each holding above his head a lighted bundle of\nincense-sticks,--red sparks that quivered like angry fireflies. Above\nthem the tall Master of Incense thundered:--\n\n\"O Spirits of the Hills and Brooks, the Land, the swollen seeds of the\nground, and all the Veins of Earth; O Thou, young Bearer of the Axe that\ncleared the Hills; O Imperial Heaven, and ye, Five Dragons of the Five\nRegions, with all the Holy Influences who pass and instantly re-pass\nthrough unutterable space:--draw near, record our oath, accept the\ndraught of blood.\"\n\nHe raised at arm's length a heavy baton, which, with a flowing movement,\nunrolled to the floor a bright yellow scroll thickly inscribed. From\nthis he read, slowly, an interminable catalogue of oaths. Heywood could\ncatch only the scolding sing-song of the responses:--\n\n\"If any brother shall break this, let him die beneath ten thousand\nknives.\"\n\n\"--Who violates this, shall be hurled down into the great sky.\"\n\n\"--Let thunder from the Five Regions annihilate him.\"\n\nSilence followed, broken suddenly by the frenzied squawking of a fowl,\nas suddenly cut short. Near the chink, Heywood heard a quick struggling\nand beating. Next instant he lay flattened against the wall.\n\nThe shutter grated open, a flood of light poured out.\n\nWithin reach, in that radiance, a pair of sinewy yellow hands gripped\nthe neck of a white cock. The wretched bird squawked once more, feebly,\nflapped its wings, and clawed the air, just as a second pair of arms\nreached out and sliced with a knife. The cock's head flew off upon the\ntiles. Hot blood spattered on Heywood's cheek. Half blinded, but not\ndaring to move, he saw the knife withdrawn, and a huge goblet held out\nto catch the flow. Then arms, goblet, and convulsive wings jerked out of\nsight, and the shutter slid home.\n\n\"Twice they've not seen me,\" thought Heywood. It was darker, here, than\nhe had hoped. He rose more boldly to the peep-hole.\n\nUnder the arch of swords, the new recruits, now standing upright,\nstretched one by one their wrists over the goblet. The Incense Master\npricked each yellow arm, to mingle human blood with the blood of the\nwhite cock; then, from a brazen vessel, filled the goblet to the brim.\nIt passed from hand to hand, like a loving-cup. Each novice raised it,\nchanted some formula, and drank. Then all dispersed. There fell\na silence.\n\nSuddenly, in the pale face of the black image seated before the shrine,\nthe eyes turned, scanning the company with a cold contempt. The lips\nmoved. The voice, level and ironic, was that of Fang, the Sword-Pen:--\n\n\"O Fragrant Ones, when shall the foreign monsters perish like this\ncock?\"\n\nA man in black, with a red wand, bowed and answered harshly:--\n\n\"The time, Great Elder Brother, draws at hand.\"\n\n\"How shall we know the hour?\"\n\n\"The hour,\" replied the Red Wand, \"shall be when the Black Dog barks.\"\n\n\"And the day?\"\n\nHeywood pressed his ear against the chink, and listened, his five senses\nfused into one.\n\nNo answer came, but presently a rapid, steady clicking, strangely\nfamiliar and commonplace. He peered in again. The Red Wand stood by the\nabacus, rattling the brown beads with flying fingers, like a shroff.\nPlainly, it was no real calculation, but a ceremony before the answer.\nThe listener clapped his ear to the crevice. Would that answer, he\nwondered, be a month, a week, to-morrow?\n\nThe shutter banged, the light streamed, down went Heywood against the\nplaster. Thick dregs from the goblet splashed on the tiles. A head, the\nflattened profile of the brisk man in yellow, leaned far out from the\nlittle port-hole. Grunting, he shook the inverted cup, let it dangle\nfrom his hands, stared up aimlessly at the stars, and then--to Heywood's\nconsternation--dropped his head to meditate, looking straight down.\n\n\"He sees me,\" thought Heywood, and held himself ready, trembling. But\nthe fellow made no sign, the broad squat features no change. The pose\nwas that of vague, comfortable thought. Yet his vision seemed to rest,\ntrue as a plumb-line, on the hiding-place. Was he in doubt?--he could\nreach down lazily, and feel.\n\nWorst of all, the greenish pallor in the eastern sky had imperceptibly\nturned brighter; and now the ribbed edge of a roof, across the way,\nbegan to glow like incandescent silver. The moon was crawling up.\n\nThe head and the dangling goblet were slowly pulled in, just before the\nmoonlight, soft and sullen through the brown haze of the heat, stole\ndown the wall and spread upon the tiles. The shutter remained open. But\nHeywood drew a free breath: those eyes had been staring into vacancy.\n\n\"Now, then,\" he thought, and sat up to the cranny; for the rattle of the\nabacus had stopped.\n\n\"The counting is complete,\" announced the Red Wand slowly, \"the hours\nare numbered. The day--\"\n\nMovement, shadow, or nameless instinct, made the listener glance upward\nswiftly. He caught the gleam of yellow silk, the poise and downward jab,\nand with a great heave of muscles went shooting down the slippery\nchannel of the cock's blood. A spearhead grazed his scalp, and smashed\na tile behind him. As he rolled over the edge, the spear itself whizzed\nby him into the dark.\n\n\"The chap saw,\" he thought, in mid-air; \"beastly clever--all the time--\"\n\nHe landed on the spear-shaft, in a pile of dry rubbish, snatched up the\nweapon, and ran, dimly conscious of a quiet scurrying behind and above\nhim, of silent men tumbling after, and doors flung violently open.\n\nHe raced blindly, but whipped about the next corner, leaving the moon at\nhis back. Westward, somebody had told him, to the gate where\ndragons met.\n\nThere had been no uproar; but running his hardest down the empty\ncorridors of the streets, he felt that the pack was gaining. Ahead\nloomed something gray, a wall, the end of a blind alley. Scale it, or\nmake a stand at the foot,--he debated, racing. Before the decision came,\na man popped out of the darkness. Heywood shifted his grip, drew back\nthe spear, but found the stranger bounding lightly alongside, and\nmuttering,--\n\n\"To the west-south, quick! A brother waits. I fool those who follow--\"\n\nObeying, Heywood dove to the left into the black slit of an alley, while\nthe other fugitive pattered straight on into the seeming trap, with a\nyelp of encouragement to the band who swept after. The alley was too\ndark for speed. Heywood ran on, fell, rose and ran, fell again, losing\nhis spear. A pair of trembling hands eagerly helped him to his feet.\n\n\"My cozin's boy, he ron quick,\" said Wutzler. \"Dose fellows, dey not\ncatch him! Kom.\"\n\nThey threaded the gloom swiftly. Wutzler, ready and certain of his\nground, led the tortuous way through narrow and greasy galleries, along\nthe side of a wall, and at last through an unlighted gate, free of\nthe town.\n\nIn the moonlight he stared at his companion, cackled, clapped his\nthighs, and bent double in unholy convulsions.\n\n\"My gracious me!\" He laughed immoderately. \"Oh, I wait zo fearful, you\nkom zo fonny!\" For a while he clung, shaking, to the young man's arm.\n\"My friendt, zo fonny you look! My gootness me!\" At last he regained\nhimself, stood quiet, and added very pointedly, \"What did _yow_ lern?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Heywood, angrily. \"Nothing. Fragrant Ones! Not a bad\nname. Phew!--Oh, I say, what did they mean? What Black Dog is to bark?\"\n\n\"Black Dog? Black Dog iss cannon.\" The man became, once more, as keen as\na gossip. \"What cannon? When dey shoot him off?\"\n\n\"Can't tell,\" said his friend. \"That's to be their signal.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" The conical hat wagged sagely. \"I go find out.\" He\npointed across the moonlit spaces. \"Ofer dere iss your house. You can no\nmore. _Schlafen Sie wohl_.\"\n\nThe two men wrung each other's hands.\n\n\"Shan't forget this, Wutz.\"\n\n\"Oh, for me--all you haf done--\" The outcast turned away, shaking his\nhead sadly.\n\nNever did Heywood's fat water-jar glisten more welcome than when he\ngained the vaulted bath-room. He ripped off his blood-stained clothes,\nscrubbed the sacrificial clots from his hair, and splashed the cool\nwater luxuriously over his exhausted body. When at last he had thrown a\nkimono about him, and wearily climbed the stairs, he was surprised to\nsee Rudolph, in the white-washed room ahead, pacing the floor and\nardently twisting his little moustache. As Heywood entered, he wheeled,\nstared long and solemnly.\n\n\"I must wait to tell you.\" He stalked forward, and with his sound left\nhand grasped Heywood's right. \"This afternoon, you--\"\n\n\"My dear boy, it's too hot. No speeches.\"\n\nBut Rudolph's emotion would not be hindered.\n\n\"This afternoon,\" he persisted, with tragic voice and eyes, \"this\nafternoon I nearly was killed.\"\n\n\"So was I.--Which seems to meet that.\" And Heywood pulled free.\n\n\"Oh,\" cried Rudolph, fervently. \"I know! I feel--If you knew what I--My\nlife--\"\n\nThe weary stoic in the blue kimono eyed him very coldly, then plucked\nhim by the sleeve.--\"Come here, for a bit.\"\n\nBoth men leaned from the window into the hot, airless night. A Chinese\nrebeck wailed, monotonous and nasal. Heywood pointed at the moon, which\nnow hung clearly above the copper haze.\n\n\"What do you see there?\" he asked dryly.\n\n\"The moon,\" replied his friend, wondering.\n\n\"Good.--You know, I was afraid you might just see Rudie Hackh.\"\n\nThe rebeck wailed a long complaint before he added:--\n\n\"If I didn't like you fairly well--The point is--Good old Cynthia! That\nbally orb may not see one of us to-morrow night, next week, next\nquarter. 'Through this same Garden, and for us in vain.' Every man Jack.\nLet me explain. It will make you better company.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nTHE WAR BOARD\n\n\"Rigmarole?\" drawled Heywood, and abstained from glancing at Chantel.\n\"Dare say. However, Gilly, their rigmarole _may_ mean business. On that\nsupposition, I made my notes urgent to you chaps.\"\n\n\"Quite right,\" said Mr. Forrester, tugging his gray moustache, and\nstudying the floor. \"Obviously. Rigmarole or not, your plan is\nthoroughly sound: stock one house, and if the pinch comes, fortify.\"\n\nChantel drummed on Heywood's long table, and smiled quaintly, with eyes\nwhich roved out at window, and from mast to bare mast of the few small\njunks that lay moored against the distant bank. He bore himself, to-day,\nlike a lazy cock of the walk. The rest of the council, Nesbit, Teppich,\nSturgeon, Kempner, and the great snow-headed padre, surrounded the table\nwith heat-worn, thoughtful faces. When they looked up, their eyes went\nstraight to Heywood at the head; so that, though deferring to his\nelders, the youngest man plainly presided.\n\nChantel turned suddenly, merrily, his teeth flashing in a laugh.\n\n\"If we are then afraid, let us all take a jonc down the river,\" he\nscoffed, \"or the next vessel for Hongkong!\"\n\nGilly's tired, honest eyes saw only the plain statement.\n\n\"Impossible.\" He shook his bullet head. \"We can't run away from a rumor,\nyou know. Can we, now? The women, perhaps. But we should lose face no\nend--horribly.\"\n\n\"Let's come to facts,\" urged Heywood. \"Arms, for example. What have we?\nTo my knowledge, one pair of good rifles, mine and Sturgeon's.\nAmmunition--uncertain, but limited. Two revolvers: my Webley.450, and\nthat little thing of Nesbit's, which is not man-stopping. Shot-guns?\nEvery one but you, padre: fit only for spring snipe, anyway, or bamboo\npartridge. Hackh has just taken over, from this house, the only real\nweapons in the settlement--one dozen old Mausers, Argentine, calibre.765.\nMy predecessor left 'em, and three cases of cartridges. I've kept\nthe guns oiled, and will warrant the lot sound.--Now, who'll lend me\nspare coolies, and stuff for sand-bags?\"\n\n\"Over where?\" puffed Sturgeon. \"Where's he taking your Mausers?\"\n\n\"Nunnery, of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say!\" Mr. Forrester looked up, with an injured air. \"As the\nsenior here, except Dr. Earle, I naturally thought the choice would be\nmy house.\"\n\n\"Right!\" cried two or three voices from the foot of the table. \"It\nshould be--Farthest off--\"\n\nAll talked at once, except Chantel, who eyed them leniently, and smiled\nas at so many absurd children. Kempner--a pale, dogged man, with a\npompous white moustache which pouted and bristled while he spoke--rose\nand delivered a pointless oration. \"Ignoring race and creed,\" he droned,\n\"we must stand together--\"\n\nHeywood balanced a pencil, twirled it, and at last took to drawing. On\nthe polished wood he scratched, with great pains, the effigy of a pig,\nwhose snout blared forth a gale of quarter-notes.\n\n\"Whistle away!\" he muttered; then resumed, as if no one had interrupted:\n\"Very good of you, Gilly. But with your permission, I see five\npoints.--Here's a rough sketch, made some time ago.\"\n\nHe tossed on the table a sheet of paper. Forrester spread it, frowning,\nwhile the others leaned across or craned over his chair.\n\n\"All out of whack, you see,\" explained the draughtsman; \"but here are my\npoints, Gilly. One: your house lies quite inland, with four sides to\ndefend: the river and marsh give Rudie's but two and a fraction. Boats?\nNot hardly: we'd soon stop that, as you'll see, if they dare.\nAnyhow,--point two,--your house is all hillocks behind, and shops\nroundabout: here's just one low ridge, and the rest clear field. Third:\nthe Portuguese built a well of sorts in the courtyard; water's deadly, I\ndare say, but your place has no well whatever. And as to four,\nsuppose--in a sudden alarm, say, those cut off by land could run another\nhalf-chance to reach the place by river.--By the way, the nunnery has a\nbell to ring.\"\n\nGilbert Forrester shoved the map along to his neighbor, and cleared his\nthroat.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he declared slowly, \"you once did me the honor to say that\nin--in a certain event, you would consider me as acting head. Frankly, I\nconfess, my plans were quite--ah!--vague. I wish to--briefly, to resign,\nin favor of this young--ah--bachelor.\"\n\n\"Don't go rotting me,\" complained Heywood, and his sallow cheeks turned\nruddy. \"I merely bring up these points. And five is this: your\ncompound's very cramped, where the nunnery could shelter the goodly\nblooming fellowship of native converts.\"\n\nChantel laughed heartily, and stretched his legs at ease under the\ntable.\n\n[Illustration: Portuguese Nunnery:--Sketch Map.]\n\n\"What strategy!\" he chuckled, preening his moustache. \"Your mythical\nsiege--it will be brief! For me, I vote no to that: no rice-Christians\nfilling their bellies--eating us into a surrender!\" He made a pantomime\nof chop-sticks. \"A compound full, eating, eating!\"\n\nOne or two nodded, approving the retort. Heywood, slightly lifting his\nchin, stared at the speaker coldly, down the length of their\ncouncil-board. The red in his cheeks burned darker.\n\n\"Our everlasting shame, then,\" he replied quietly. \"It will be\neverlasting, if we leave these poor devils in the lurch, after cutting\nthem loose from their people. Excuse me, padre, but it's no time to\nmince our words. We made them strangers in their own land. Desert 'em?\nDamned if we do!\"\n\nNo one made reply. The padre, who had looked up, looked down quickly,\nmusing, and smoothed his white hair with big fingers that\nsomewhat trembled.\n\n\"Besides,\" continued the speaker, in a tone of apology, \"we'll need 'em\nto man the works. Meantime, you chaps must lend coolies, eh? Look here.\"\nWith rising spirits, he traced an eager finger along the map. \"I must\nrun a good strong bamboo scaffold along the inside wall, with plenty of\nsand-bags ready for loopholing--specially atop the servants' quarters\nand pony-shed, and in that northeast angle, where we'll throw up a\nmound or platform.--What do you say? Suggestions, please!\"\n\nChantel, humming a tune, reached for his helmet, and rose. He paused,\nstruck a match, and in an empty glass, shielding the flame against the\nbreeze of the punkah, lighted a cigarette.\n\n\"Since we have appointed our dictator,\" he began amiably, \"we may\nrepose--\"\n\nFrom the landing, without, a coolie bawled impudently for the master of\nthe house.\n\n\"Wutzler!\" said Heywood, jumping up. \"I mean--his messenger.\"\n\nHe was gone a noticeable time, but came back smiling.\n\n\"Good news, Gilly.\" He held aloft a scrap of Chinese paper, scrawled on\nwith pencil. \"We need expect nothing these ten days. They wait for more\nammunition--'more shoots,' the text has it. The Hak Kau--their Black\nDog--is a bronze cannon, nine feet long, cast at Rotterdam in 1607. He\nwrites, 'I saw it in shed last night, but is gone to-day. O.W.'\nGentlemen, for a timid man, our friend does not scamp his reports.\nThorough, rather? Little O.W. is O.K.\"\n\nChantel, still humming, had moved toward the door. All at once he\nhalted, and stared from the landward window. Cymbals clashed\nsomewhere below.\n\n\"What's this?\" he cried sharply. The noise drew nearer, more brazen,\nand with it a clatter of hoofs. \"Here come swordsmen!\"\n\n\"To play with you, I suppose. Your fame has spread.\" Heywood spoke with\na slow, mischievous drawl; but he crossed the room quickly. \"What's up?\"\n\nBelow, by the open gate, a gay grotesque rider reined in a piebald pony,\nand leaning down, handed to the house-boy a ribbon of scarlet paper.\nBehind him, to the clash of cymbals, a file of men in motley robes\nswaggered into position, wheeled, and formed the ragged front of a\nFalstaff regiment. Overcome by the scarlet ribbon, the long-coated \"boy\"\nbowed, just as through the gate, like a top-heavy boat swept under an\narch, came heaving an unwieldy screened chair, borne by four broad men:\nnot naked and glistening coolies, but \"Tail-less Horses\" in proud\nlivery. Before they could lower their shafts, Heywood ran clattering\ndown the stairs.\n\nSlowly, cautiously, like a little fat old woman, there clambered out\nfrom the broadcloth box a rotund man, in flowing silks, and a conical,\ntasseled hat of fine straw. He waddled down the compound path, shading\nwith his fan a shrewd, bland face, thoughtful, yet smooth as a babe's.\n\nThe watchers in the upper room saw Heywood greet him with extreme\nceremony, and heard the murmur of \"Pray you, I pray you,\" as with\nendless bows and deprecations the two men passed from sight, within the\nhouse. A long time dragged by. The visitor did not join the company, but\nfrom another room, now and then, sounded his clear-pitched voice, full\nof odd and courteous modulations. When at last the conference ended, and\ntheir unmated footsteps crossed the landing, a few sentences echoed from\nthe stairway.\n\n\"That is all,\" declared the voice, pleasantly. \"The Chow Ceremonial\nsays, 'That man is unwise who knowingly throws away precious things.'\nAnd in the Analects we read, 'There is merit in dispatch.'\"\n\nHeywood's reply was lost, except the words, \"stupid people.\"\n\n\"In every nation,\" agreed the placid voice. \"It is true. What says the\nViceroy of Hupeh: 'They see a charge of bird-shot, and think they are\ntasting broiled owl.'--Walk slowly!\"\n\n\"A safe walk, Your Excellency.\"\n\nThe cymbals struck up, the cavalcade, headed by ragamuffin lictors with\nwhips, went swaying past the gate. Heywood, when he returned,\nwas grinning.\n\n\"Wonderful old chap!\" he exclaimed. \"Hates this station, I fancy, much\nas we hate it.\"\n\n\"Anything to concern us?\" asked Gilly.\n\n\"Intimated he could beat me at chess,\" laughed the young man, \"and will\nbet me a jar of peach wine to a box of Manila cigars!\"\n\nChantel, from a derisive dumb-show near the window, had turned to waddle\nsolemnly down the room. At sight of Heywood's face he stopped guiltily.\n\n\"Chantel!\" All the laughter was gone from the voice and the hard gray\neyes. \"Yesterday we humored you tin-soldier fashion, but to-day let's\nput away childish things.--I like that magistrate, plainly, a damned\ndeal better than I like you. When you or I show one half his ability,\nwe're free to mock him--in my house.\"\n\nFor the first time within the memory of any man present, the mimic\nwilted.\n\n\"I--I did not know,\" he stammered, \"that old man was your friend.\" Very\nquiet, and a little flushed, he took his seat among the others.\n\n\"I like him no end.\" Still more quiet, Heywood appealed to the company.\n\"Part for his hard luck--stuck down, a three-year term, in this\nneglected hole. Enemies in power, higher up. Fang, the Sword-Pen, in\ngreat favor up there.--What? Oh, said nothing directly, of course.\nFriendly call, and all that. But his indirections speak straight enough.\nWe understood each other. The dregs of the town are all stirred\nup--bottomside topside--danger point. He, in case--you know--can't give\nus any help. No means, no recourse. His chief's fairly itching to\ncashier him.--Spoke highly of your hospital work, padre, but said, 'Even\ngood deeds may be misconstrued.'--In short, gentlemen, without saying a\nword, he tells us honestly in plain terms, 'Sorry, but look out for\nyourselves.'\"\n\nA beggar rattled his bowl of cash in the road, below; from up the river\nsounded wailing cries.\n\n\"Did he mention,\" said the big padre, presently, \"the case against my\nman, Chok Chung?\"\n\nHeywood's eyes became evasive, his words reluctant.\n\n\"The magistrate dodged that--that unpleasant subject. The case was\nforced on him. Some understrapper tried it. Let's be fair.\"\n\nDr. Earle's great elbows left the board. Without rising, he seemed to\ngrow in bulk and stature, and send his vision past the company, into\nthose things which are not, to confound the things which are.\n\n\"For myself, it does not matter. 'He buries His workmen, but carries on\nHis work.'\" The man spoke in a heavy, broken voice, as though it were\nhis body that suffered. \"But it comes hard to hear, from a young man, so\ngood a friend, after many years\"--The deep-set eyes returned, and with a\nsudden lustre, made a sharp survey from face to face. \"If I have made my\nflock a remnant--aliens--rejected--tell me, what shall I do? Tell me. I\nhave shut eyes and conscience, and never meddled, never!--not even when\nmoney was levied for the village idols. And here's a man beaten, cast\ninto prison--\"\n\nHe shoved both fists out on the table, and bowed his white head.\n\n\"My safety is nothing. But yours--and his.--To keep one, I desert the\nother. Either way.\" The padre groaned. \"What must I choose?\"\n\n\"We're all quite helpless,\" said Heywood, gently. \"Quite. It's a long\nway to the nearest gunboat.\"\n\n\"Tell me,\" repeated the other, stubbornly.\n\nAt the same moment it happened that the cries came louder along the\nriver-bank, and that some one bounded up the stairs.\n\nThe runner was Rudolph. All morning he had gone about his errands very\ncalmly, playing the man of action, in a new philosophy learned\novernight. But now he forgot to imitate his teacher, and darted in, so\nheadlong that all the dogs came with him, bouncing and barking.\n\n\"Look,\" he called, stumbling toward the farther window, while Flounce\nthe terrier and a wonk puppy ran nipping at his heels. \"Come, look at\nthem! Out on the river!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nTHE SPARE MAN\n\nBeyond the scant greenery of Heywood's garden--a ropy little banyan, a\nlow rank of glossy whampee leaves, and the dusty sage-green tops of\nstunted olives--glared the river. Wide, savage sunlight lay so hot upon\nit, that to aching eyes the water shone solid, like a broad road of\nyellow clay. Only close at hand and by an effort of vision, appeared the\ntiny, quiet lines of the irresistible flood pouring toward the sea;\nthere whipped into the pool of banyan shade black snippets and tails of\nreflection, darting ceaselessly after each other like a shoal of\nfrightened minnows. But elsewhere the river lay golden, solid, and\npainfully bright. Things afloat, in the slumberous procession of all\nEastern rivers, swam downward imperceptibly, now blurred, now outlined\nin corrosive sharpness.\n\nThe white men stood crowding along the spacious window. The dogs barked\noutrageously; but at last above their din floated, as before, the high\nwailing cries. A heaping cairn of round-bellied, rosy-pink earthen jars\ncame steering past, poled by a naked statue of new copper, who balanced\nprecariously on the edge of his hidden raft. No sound came from him; nor\nfrom the funeral barge which floated next, where still figures in white\nrobes guarded the vermilion drapery of a bier, decked with vivid green\nboughs. All these were silent.\n\n\"No, above!\" cried Rudolph, pointing.\n\nAfter the mourners' barge, at some distance, came hurrying a boat\ncrowded with shining yellow bodies and dull blue jackets. Long bamboo\npoles plied bumping along her gunwale, sticking into the air all about\nher, many and loose and incoordinate, like the ribs of an unfinished\nbasket. From the bow spurted a white puff of smoke. The dull report of a\nmusket lagged across the water.\n\nThe bullet skipped like a schoolboy's pebble, ripping out little rags of\nwhite along that surface of liquid clay.\n\nThe line of fire thus revealed, revealed the mark. Untouched, a black\nhead bobbed vigorously in the water, some few yards before the boat. The\nsaffron crew, poling faster, yelled and cackled at so clean a miss,\nwhile a coolie in the bow reloaded his matchlock.\n\nThe fugitive head labored like that of a man not used to swimming, and\ndesperately spent. It now gave a quick twist, and showed a distorted\nface, almost of the same color with the water.\n\nThe mouth gaped black in a sputtering cry, then closed choking,\nsquirted out water, and gaped once more, to wail clearly:--\n\n\"I am Jesus Christ!\"\n\nIn the broad, bare daylight of the river, this lonely and sudden\nblasphemy came as though a person in a dream might declare himself to a\nwaking audience of skeptics. The cry, sharp with forlorn hope, rang like\nan appeal.\n\n\"Why--look,\" stammered Heywood. \"He sees us--heading here. Look,\nit's--Quick! let me out!\"\n\nJust as he turned to elbow through his companions, and just as the cry\nsounded again, the matchlock blazed from the bow. No bullet skipped. The\nswimmer, who had reached the shallows, suddenly rose with an incredible\nheave, like a leaping salmon, flung one bent arm up and back in the\ngesture of the Laocooen, and pitched forward with a turbid splash. The\nquivering darkness under the banyan blotted everything: death had\ndispersed the black minnows there, in oozy wriggles of shadow; but next\nmoment the fish-tail stripes chased in a more lively shoal. The gleaming\npotter, below his rosy cairn, stared. The mourners forgot their grief.\n\nHeywood, after his impulse of rescue, stood very quiet.\n\n\"You saw,\" he repeated dully. \"You all saw.\"\n\nThe clutching figure, bolt upright in the soaked remnant of prison\nrags, had in that leap and fall shown himself for Chok Chung, the\nChristian. He had sunk in mystery, to become at one forever with the\ndrunken cormorant-fisher.\n\nObscene delight raged in the crowded boat, with yells and laughter, and\nflourish of bamboo poles.\n\n\"Come away from the window,\" said Heywood; and then to the white-haired\ndoctor: \"Your question's answered, padre. Strange, to come so quick.\" He\njerked his thumb back toward the river. \"And that's only first blood.\"\n\nThe others had broken into wrangling.\n\n\"Escaped? Nonsense--Cat--and--mouse game, I tell you; those devils let\nhim go merely to--We'll never know--Of course! Plain as your nose--To\nstand by, and never lift a hand! Oh, it's--Rot! Look here,\nwhy--Acquitted, then set on him--But we'll _never_ know!--Fang watching\non the spot. Trust him!\"\n\nA calm \"boy,\" in sky-blue gown, stood beside them, ready to speak. The\ndispute paused, while they turned for his message. It was a\ndisappointing trifle: Mrs. Forrester waited below for her husband, to\nwalk home.\n\n\"Can't leave now,\" snapped Gilly. \"I'll be along, tell her--\"\n\n\"Had she better go alone?\" suggested Heywood.\n\n\"No; right you are.\" The other swept a fretful eye about the company.\n\"But this business begins to look urgent.--Here, somebody we can spare.\nYou go, Hackh, there's a good chap.\"\n\nChantel dropped the helmet he had caught up. Bowing stiffly, Rudolph\nmarched across the room and down the stairs. His face, pale at the late\nspectacle, had grown red and sulky, \"Can spare me, can you?--I'm the\none.\" He descended, muttering.\n\nViewing himself thus, morosely, as rejected of men, he reached the\ncompound gate to fare no better with the woman. She stood waiting in the\nshadow of the wall; and as he drew unwillingly near, the sight of\nher--to his shame and quick dismay--made his heart leap in welcome. She\nwore the coolest and severest white, but at her throat the same small\nfurbelow, every line of which he had known aboard ship, in the days of\nhis first exile and of his recent youth. It was now as though that youth\ncame flooding back to greet her.\n\n\"Good-morning.\" He forgot everything, except that for a few priceless\nmoments they would be walking side by side.\n\nShe faced him with a start, never so young and beautiful as now--her\nblue eyes wide, scornful, and blazing, her cheeks red and lips\ntrembling, like a child ready to cry.\n\n\"I did not want _you_\" she said curtly.\n\n\"Nor did they.\" Pride forged the retort for him, at a blow. He explained\nin the barest of terms, while she eyed him steadily, with every sign of\nrising temper.\n\n\"I can spare you, too,\" she whipped out; then turned to walk away,\nholding her helmet erect, in the poise of a young goddess, pert\nbut warlike.\n\nThis double injustice left Rudolph chafing. In two strides, however, he\nhad overtaken her.\n\n\"I am under orders,\" he stated grimly.\n\nHer pace gradually slackened in the growing heat; but she went forward\nwith her eyes fixed on the littered, sunken flags of their path. This\nrankling silence seemed to him more unaccountable and deadly than all\nformer mischances, and left him far more alone. From the sultry tops of\nbamboos, drooping like plants in an oven, an amorous multitude of\ncicadas maintained the buzzing torment of steel on emery wheels, as\nthough the universal heat had chafed and fretted itself into a dry,\nfeverish utterance. Once Mrs. Forrester looked about, quick and angry,\nlike one ready to choke that endless voice. But for the rest, the two\nstrange companions moved steadily onward.\n\nIn an alley of checkered light a buffalo with a wicker nose-ring, and\nheavy, sagging horns that seemed to jerk his head back in agony, heaved\ntoward them, ridden by a naked yellow infant in a nest-like saddle of\ngreen fodder. Scenting with fright the disgusting presence of white\naliens, the sleep-walking monster shied, opened his eyes, and lowered\nhis blue muzzle as if to charge. There was a pause, full of menace.\n\n\"Don't run!\" said Rudolph, and catching the woman roughly about the\nshoulders, thrust her behind him. She clutched him tightly by the\nwounded arm.\n\nThe buffalo stared irresolute, with evil eyes. The naked boy in the\ngreen nest brushed a swarm of flies from his handful of sticky\nsweetmeats, looked up, pounded the clumsy shoulders, and shrilled a\ncommand. Staring doubtfully, and trembling, the buffalo swayed past, the\nwrinkled armor of his gray hide plastered with dry mud as with yellow\nochre. To the slow click of hoofs, the surly monster, guided by a little\nchild, went swinging down the pastoral shade,--ancient yet living shapes\nfrom a picture immemorial in art and poetry.\n\n\"Please,\" begged Rudolph, trying with his left hand to loosen her grip.\n\"Please, that hurts.\"\n\nFor a second they stood close, their fingers interlacing. With a touch\nof contempt, he found that she still trembled, and drew short breath.\nHer eyes slowly gathered his meaning.\n\n\"Oh, that!\" She tore her hand loose, as though burned. \"That! It _was_\nall true, then. I forgot.\"\n\nShe caught aside her skirts angrily, and started forward in all her\nformer disdain. But this, after their brief alliance, was not to be\ntolerated.\n\n\"What was all true?\" he insisted. \"You shall not treat me so. If anybody\nhas a right--\"\n\nAfter several paces, she flashed about at him in a whirl of words:--\n\n\"All alike, every one of you! And I was fool enough to think you were\ndifferent!\" The conflict in her eyes showed real, beyond suspicion. \"He\ntold me all about it. Last evening. And you dare talk of rights, and\ncome following me here--\"\n\n\"Lucky I did,\" retorted Rudolph, with sudden spirit; and holding out his\nwounded arm, indignantly: \"That scratch, if you know how it came--\"\n\n\"I know, perfectly.\" She stared as at some crowning impudence. \"He was\nchicken-hearted. You came off cheaply.--I know all you said. But the one\nthing I'll never understand, is where you found the courage, after he\nstruck you, at the club. You'll always have _that_ to admire!\"\n\n\"After he struck\"--A light broke in on Rudolph, somehow. \"Chantel? Oh,\nthat liar!\"\n\nHe wheeled and started to go back.\n\n\"Wait, stop!\" she called, in a strangely altered voice, which brought\nhim up short. \"They're all with him now. You can't--What did you mean?\"\n\nHe explained, sulkily at first, but ending in a kind of generous rage.\n\"So I couldn't even stand up to him. And except for Maurice Heywood--Oh,\nyou need not frown; he's the best friend I ever had.\"\n\nMrs. Forrester had walked on, with the same cloudy aspect, the same\nlight, impatient step. He felt the greater surprise when, suddenly\nturning, she raised toward him her odd, enticing, pointed face, and the\nfriendly mischief of her eyes.\n\n\"The best?\" she echoed, in the same half-whisper as when she had\nflattered him, that afternoon in the dusky well of the pagoda stairway.\n\"The very best friend? Don't you think you have a better?\"\n\nRudolph stared.\n\n\"Oh, you funny, funny boy!\" she cried, with a bewildering laugh, of\ndelight and pride. \"I hate people all prim and circumspect, and\nyou--You'd have flown back there straight at him, before my--before all\nthe others. That's why I like you so!--But you must leave that horrid,\nlying fellow to me.\"\n\nAll unaware, she had led him along the blinding white wall of the\nForrester compound, and halted in the hot shadow that lay under the\ntiled gateway. As though timidly, her hand stole up and rested on\nhis forearm.\n\n\"So sorry.\" The confined space, narrow and covered, gave to her voice a\nplaintive ring. \"That's twice you protected me, and I hurt you.--You\n_are_ different. This doesn't happen between people, often. When you\ndid--that, for me, yesterday, didn't it seem different and rather\nsplendid, and--like a book?\"\n\n\"It seemed nonsense,\" replied Rudolph, sturdily. \"The heat. We were\nfools.\"\n\nShe laughed again, and at close range watched him from under consciously\ndrooping lashes that almost veiled a liquid brilliancy. Everywhere the\ncicadas kept the heat vibrating with their strident buzz. It recalled\nsome other widespread mist of treble music, long ago. The trilling of\nfrogs, that had been, before.\n\n\"You dear, brave boy,\" she said slowly. \"You're so honest, too. I'm not\nungrateful. Do you know what I'd like--Oh, there's the _amah!\"_\n\nShe drew back, with an impatient gesture.\n\n\"That stupid, fat Mrs. Earle's waiting for me.--I hate to leave you.\"\nThe stealthy brightness of her admiration changed to a slow, inscrutable\nappeal. \"Don't forget. Haven't you--a better friend?\" And with an\ninstant, bold, and tantalizing grimace, she had vanished within.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTo his homeward march, her cicadas shrilled the music of fifes. He, the\ndespised, the man to spare, now cocked up his helmet like fortune's\nminion, dizzy with new honors. Nobody had ever praised him to his face.\nAnd now she, she of all the world, had spoken words which he feared and\nlonged to believe, and which even said still less than her searching and\nmysterious look.\n\nOn the top of his exultation, he reached the nunnery, and entered his\nbig, bare living-room, to find Heywood stretched in a wicker chair.\n\n\"Hallo, Rudie! I've asked myself to tiffin,\" drawled the lounger, from a\nlittle tempest of blue smoke, tossed by the punkah. \"How's the fair\nBertha?--Mausers all right? And by the way, did you make that inventory\nof provisions?\"\n\nRudolph faced him with a sudden conviction of guilt, of treachery to a\nleader.\n\n\"Yes,\" he stammered; \"I--I'll get it for you.\"\n\nHe passed into his bedroom, caught up the written list from a table, and\nfor a moment stood as if dreaming. Before him the Mausers, polished and\norderly, shone in their new rack against the lime-coated wall. Though\nappearing to scan them, Rudolph saw nothing but his inward confusion.\n\"After all this man did for me,\" he mused. What had loosed the bond,\nswept away all the effects?\n\nA sound near the window made him turn. An imp in white and red livery,\nPeng, the little billiard-marker from the club, stood hurling things\nviolently into the outer glare.\n\n\"What thing you do?\" called Rudolph, sharply.\n\nSome small but heavy object clattered on the floor. The urchin stooped,\nsnatched it up, and flung it hurtling clean over the garden to the\nriver. He turned, grinning amiably. \"Goo-moh? ning-seh. How too you\ntoo,\" he chanted. \"I am welly? glat to-see you.\" A boat-coolie, he\nexplained, had called this house bad names. He, Peng, threw stones.\nBad man.\n\n\"Out of here, you rascal!\" Rudolph flicked a riding-whip at the\nscampering legs, as the small defender of his honor bolted for\nthe stairs.\n\n\"What's wrong?\"\n\nHeywood appeared promptly at the door.\n\nFrom the road, below, a gleeful voice piped:--\n\n\"Goat-men! Baby-killers!\"\n\nIn the noon blaze, Peng skipped derisively, jeered at them, performed a\nbrief but indecorous pantomime, and then, kicking up his heels with joy,\nscurried for his life.\n\n\"Chucked his billet,\" said Heywood, without surprise. \"Little devil, I\nalways thought--What's missing?\"\n\nRudolph scanned his meagre belongings, rummaged his dressing-table,\nopened a wardrobe.\n\n\"Nothing,\" he answered. \"A boat-coolie--\"\n\nBut Heywood had darted to the rack of Mausers, knelt, and sprung up,\nraging.\n\n\"Side-bolts! Man,\" he cried, in a voice that made Rudolph jump,--\"man,\nwhy didn't you stop him? The side-bolts, all but two.--Young heathen,\nhe's crippled us: one pair of rifles left.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nOFF DUTY\n\nThe last of the sunlight streamed level through a gap in the western\nridges. It melted, with sinuous, tender shadows, the dry contour of\nfield and knoll, and poured over all the parching land a liquid,\nundulating grace. Like the shadow of clouds on ripe corn, the red tiles\nof the village roofs patched the countryside. From the distant sea had\ncome a breath of air, cool enough to be felt with gratitude, yet so\nfaint as neither to disturb the dry pulsation of myriad insect-voices,\nnor to blur the square mirrors of distant rice-fields, still tropically\nblue or icy with reflected clouds.\n\nMiss Drake paused on the knoll, and looked about her.\n\n\"This remains the same, doesn't it, for all our troubles?\" she said;\nthen to herself, slowly, \"'It is a beauteous evening, calm and free.'\"\n\nHeywood made no pretense of following her look.\n\n\"'Dear Nun,'\" he blurted; \"no, how does it go again?--'dear child, that\nwalkest with me here--'\"\n\nThe girl started down the <DW72>, with the impatience of one whose mood\nis frustrated. The climate had robbed her cheeks of much color, but not,\nit seemed, of all.\n\n\"Your fault,\" said Heywood, impenitent. \"Merely to show you. I could\nquote, once.\"\n\n\"Aged Man!\" She laughed, as though glad of this turn. \"I like you better\nin prose. Go on, please, where we left off. What did you do then?\"\n\nHeywood's smile, half earnest, half mischievous, obediently faded.\n\n\"Oh, that! Why, then, of course, I discharged Rudolph's gatekeeper, put\na trusty of my own in his place, sent out to hire a diver, and turned\nall hands to hunting. 'Obviously,' as Gilly would say.--We picked up two\nside-bolts in the garden, by the wall, one in the mud outside, and three\nthe diver got in shallow water. Total recovered, six; plus two Peng had\nno time for, eight. We can ill spare four guns, though; and the affair\nshows they keep a beastly close watch.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Drake, absently; then drew a slow breath. \"Peng was the\nmost promising pupil we had.\"\n\n\"He was,\" stated her companion, \"a little, unmitigated, skipping,\norange-tawny goblin!\"\n\nShe made no reply. As they footed slowly along the winding path,\nFlounce, the fox-terrier, who had scouted among strange clumps of\nbamboo, now rejoined them briskly, cantering with her fore-legs\ndelicately stiff and joyful. Miss Drake stooped to pat her, saying:--\n\n\"Poor little dog. Little Foreign Dog!\" She rose with a sigh, to add\nincongruously, \"Oh, the things we dream beforehand, and then the things\nthat happen!\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Heywood looked at her keenly. \"Sometimes they're the\nsame.\"\n\nThe jealous terrier scored her dusty paws down his white drill, from\nknee to ankle, before he added:--\n\n\"You know how the Queen of Heaven won her divinity.\"\n\n\"Another,\" said the girl, \"of your heathen stories?\"\n\n\"Rather a pretty one,\" he retorted. \"It happened in a seaport, a good\nmany hundred miles up the coast. A poor girl lived there, with her\nmother, in a hut. One night a great gale blew, so that everybody was\nanxious. Three junks were out somewhere at sea, in that storm. The girl\nlay there in the dark. Her sweetheart on board, it would be in a Western\nstory; but these were only her friends, and kin, and townsmen, that were\nat stake. So she lay there in the hut, you see, and couldn't rest. And\nthen it seemed to her, in the dark, that she was swimming out through\nthe storm, out and out, and not in the least afraid. She had become\nlarger, and more powerful, somehow, than the rain, or the dark, or the\nwhole ocean; for when she came upon the junks tossing there, she took\none in each hand, the third in her mouth, and began to swim for home.\nJust retrieved 'em, you know. But then across the storm she heard her\nmother calling in the dark, and had to open her mouth to answer. So she\nlost that junk.\"\n\n\"Well, then her spirit was back in the hut. But next day the two junks\ncame in; the third one, never. And for that dream, she was made, after\nher death, the great and merciful Queen of Heaven.\"\n\nAs Heywood ended, they were entering a pastoral village, near the town,\nbut hidden low under great trees, ancient and widely gnarled.\n\n\"You told that,\" said Miss Drake, \"as though it had really happened.\"\n\n\"If you believe, these things have reality; if not, they have none.\" His\ngesture, as he repeated the native maxim, committed him to neither side.\n\nMiss Drake looked back toward the hills.\n\n\"Her dream was play, compared to--some.\"\n\n\"That,\" he answered, \"is abominably true.\"\n\nThe curt, significant tone made her glance at him quickly. In her dark\neyes there was no impatience, but only trouble.\n\n\"We do better,\" she said, \"when we are both busy.\"\n\nHe nodded, as though reluctantly agreeing, not so much to the words as\nto the silence which followed.\n\nThe evening peace, which lay on the fields and hills, had flooded even\nthe village streets. Without pause, without haste, the endless labor of\nthe day went on as quiet as a summer cloud. Meeting or overtaking,\ncoolies passed in single file, their bare feet slapping the enormous\nflags of antique, sunken granite, their twin baskets bobbing and\ncreaking to the rhythm of their wincing trot. The yellow muscles rippled\nstrongly over straining ribs, as with serious faces, and slant eyes\nintent on their path, they chanted in pairs the ageless refrain, the\ncall and answer which make burdens lighter:--\n\n\n\"O heh!--O ha?\n O ho ho!\n O heh!--O ha?\n O ho ho!\"\n\n\nFrom hidden places sounded the whir of a jade-cutter's wheel, a\ncobbler's rattle, or the clanging music of a forge. Yet everywhere the\nslow movements, the faded, tranquil colors,--dull blue garments, dusky\nred tiles, deep bronze-green foliage overhanging a vista of subdued\nwhite and gray,--consorted with the spindling shadows and low-streaming\nvesper light. Keepers of humble shops lounged in the open air with their\ngossips, smoking bright pipes of the Yunnan white copper, nodding and\nblinking gravely. Above them, no less courteous and placid, little\ndoorway shrines besought the Earth-God to lead the Giver of Wealth\nwithin. Sometimes, where a narrow lane gaped opposite a door, small\nstone lions sat grinning upon pillars, to scare away the Secret Arrow of\nmisfortune. But these rarely: the village seemed a happy place, favored\nof the Influences. In the grateful coolness men came and went, buying,\njoking, offering neighborly advice to chance-met people.\n\nA plump woman, who carried two tiny silver fish in an immense flat\nbasket, grinned at Miss Drake, and pointed roguishly.\n\n\"See the two boats going by!\" she called. \"Her feet are bigger than my\nGolden Lilies!\" And laughing, she wriggled her own dusty toes, strong,\nfree, and perfect in modeling.\n\nAn old, withered barber looked up from shaving a blue forehead, under a\ntree.\n\n\"Their women,\" he growled, \"are shameless, and walk everywhere!\"\n\nBut a stern man, bearing a palm-leaf fan and a lark in a cage, frowned\nhim down.\n\n\"She brought my son safe out of the Three Sicknesses,\" he declared.\n\"Mind your trade, Catcher of Lively Ones!\" Then bending over the cage,\nwith solicitude, he began gently to fan the lark. As Heywood and the\ngirl paused beside him, he glanced up, and smiled gravely. \"I give my\npet his airing,\" he said; and then, quickly but quietly, \"When you reach\nthe town, do not pass through the West Quarter. It is full of\nevil-minded persons. Their placards are posted.\"\n\nA shrill trio of naked boys came racing and squabbling, to offer\ngrasshoppers for sale.\n\n\"We have seen no placards,\" replied Heywood.\n\n\"You will to-morrow,\" said the owner of the lark, calmly; and squatting,\nbecame engrossed in poking a grasshopper between the brown, varnished\nsplints of the cage. \"Maker of Music, here is your evening rice.\"\n\nThe two companions passed on, with Flounce timidly at heel.\n\n\"You see,\" Heywood broke out. \"Warnings everywhere. Now please, won't\nyou listen to my advice? No telling when the next ship _will_ call, but\nwhen it does--\"\n\n\"I can't run away.\" She spoke as one clinging to a former answer. \"I\nmust stand by my dream, such as it used to be--and even such as it is.\"\n\nHe eyed her sadly, shook his head, and said no more. For a moment they\nhalted, where the path broadened on a market-place, part shade, part\nluminous with golden dust. A squad of lank boys, kicking miraculously\nwith flat upturned soles, kept a wicker ball shining in the air, as true\nand lively as a plaything on a fountain-jet. Beyond, their tiny juniors,\ngirls and boys knee-high, and fat tumbling babies in rainbow finery, all\nhand-locked and singing, turned their circle inside out and back again,\nin the dizzy graces of the \"Water Wheel.\" Other boys, and girls still\ntrousered and queued like boys, played at hopscotch, in and out among\nshoes that lay across the road. All traffic, even the steady trotting\ncoolies, fetched a lenient compass roundabout.\n\n\"Lucky Hand, Lucky Hand! Allow me to pass,\" begged a coffin-maker's man,\nbent under a plank. \"These Long-Life boards are heavy.\"\n\n\"Ho, Lame Chicken!\" called another, blocked by the hop-scotch. He was a\nbrown grass-cutter, who grinned, and fondled a smoky cloth that\nbuzzed--some tribe of wild bees, captured far afield. \"Ho, Lame Chicken!\nDo not bump me. They will sting.\"\n\nHe came through safely; for at the same moment the musical \"Cling-clank\"\nof a sweetmeat-seller's bell turned the game into a race. The way was\nclear, also, for a tiny, aged collector of paper, flying the gay flag of\nan \"Exalted Literary Society,\" and plodding, between two great baskets,\non his pious rounds. \"Revere and spare,\" he piped, at intervals,--\n\"revere and spare the Written Word!\"\n\nAll the bright picture lingered with the two alien wayfarers, long after\nthey had passed and the sun had withdrawn from their path. In the hoary\npeace of twilight,--\n\n\"What can _we_ do here?\" the girl cried abruptly. \"There--I never meant\nto say it. But it runs in my head all the time. I work and work, to keep\nit down. What can we do here?\"\n\nHeywood watched her face, set straight before them, and now more clearly\ncut in the failing light. Were there only pride in those fine and\nresolute lines, it might have been a face from some splendid coin, or\nmedal of victory.\n\n\"You work too hard,\" he said. \"Think, instead, of all the good--\"\n\nBut at that she seemed to wince.\n\n\"The good? As if there weren't dark streets and crooked children at\nhome! Oh, the pride and ignorance that sent me here!\" She spoke quietly,\nwith a kind of wonder. \"Just blind, ignorant feelings, I took them\nfor--for something too great and mysterious. It's all very strange to\nlook back on, and try to put into words. I remember painted glass, and\nsolemn music--and thinking--then!--that I knew this lovely and terrible\nworld--and its Maker and Master.\" She looked down the dusky lanes,\nwhere glowworm lanterns began to bob and wink. \"Oh, this land! where you\nsee the days running into years!\"\n\n\"The Dragon's a wise old beast,\" he ventured. \"He teaches--something.\"\n\nShe assented gravely:--\n\n\"And in those days I thought it was a dark continent--of lost souls.\"\n\n\"There are no dark continents,\" declared Heywood suddenly, in a broken\nvoice. \"The heart of one man--can hold more darkness--You would never\nsee into it--\"\n\n\"Don't!\" she cried sharply. \"What did we promise?\"\n\nThey stood close in the dusk, and a tremor, a wave, passed through them\nboth.\n\n\"I forgot--I couldn't help\"--he stammered; then, as they stumbled\nforward, he regained his former tone, keen and ready. \"Mustn't get to\nfussing about our work, must we?--Curious thing: speaking of dreams, you\nknow. The other night I thought you were somewhere out on board a junk,\nand Flounce with you. I swam like anything, miles and miles, but\ncouldn't get out to you. Worked like steam, and no headway. Flounce knew\nI was coming, but you didn't. Deuced odd, how real it seemed.\"\n\nShe laughed, as though they had walked past some danger.\n\n\"And speaking of dragons,\" she rejoined. \"They _do_ help. The man in\nthe story, that dipped in dragon's blood, was made invulnerable.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" He stood plainly at a loss. \"Oh, I see. German, wasn't he?--Pity\nthey didn't pop Rudie Hackh in!\"\n\nHer swift upward glance might have been admiration, if she had not\nsaid:--\n\n\"Your mind works very slowly.\"\n\n\"Oh?\" Again he paused, as though somewhat hurt; then answered\ncheerfully: \"Dare say. Always did. Thought at first you meant the\nrattan-juice kind, from Sumatra.\"\n\nThe gate of the town yawned black. From the streets glimmered a few\nlanterns, like candles in a long cave. But shunning these unfriendly\ncorridors, he led her roundabout, now along the walls, now through the\ndim ways of an outlying hamlet. A prolonged shriek of growing fright and\nanguish came slowly toward them--the cry of a wheelbarrow carrying the\ngreat carcass of a pig, waxy white and waxy red, like an image from a\nchamber of horrors. In the blue twilight, fast deepening, the most\nfamiliar things became grotesque. A woman's voice telling stories behind\nshadow pictures, and the capricious play of the black puppets on her\nlighted screen, had the effect of incantation. Before the booth of a\ndentist, the long strings of black teeth swayed in the lantern-glow,\nrattling, like horrid necklaces of cannibals. And from a squat\nden--where on a translucent placard in the dull window flickered the\nwords \"Foreign Earth,\" and the guttering door-lantern hinted \"As You\nLike It\"--there came a sweet, insidious, potent smell that seemed more\npoisonous than mere opium.\n\n\"Let's go faster,\" said the girl. \"Somehow, the dark makes me uneasy\nto-night.\"\n\nSkirting the town, they struck at last the open road beyond, and saw\nagainst a fading sky the low black bulk of the nunnery, pierced with\norange squares. Past its landward wall, lanterns moved slowly, clustered\nhere and there by twos and threes, and dispersed. Cackling argument came\nfrom the ditch, wherever the lantern-bearers halted; and on the face of\nthe wall, among elbowing shadows, shone dim strips of scarlet. Both\npillars of the gate were plastered with them.\n\n\"Placards,\" said Heywood. \"Things are ripening fast.\" Lighting match\nfrom match, he studied the long red scrolls, crowded with neat rows of\nsymbols. He read them off slowly.\n\n'The Garden of the Three Exquisites.'--Pshaw! that's a theatre notice:\nenterprising manager.--Ah, more like it. Long preamble, regular\ntrimetrical platitudes--here we are:--\n\n\"'These Red-Bristled Ghosts teach their dupes to break the ancestral\ntablets, and to worship the picture of a naked infant, which points one\nfinger toward heaven, another toward earth.--To each man entering the\nFalse Religion, a pill is given which confuses and darkens the\nmind.--Why they dig out babies' eyes: from one hundred pounds of Chinese\nlead can be extracted seven pounds of silver, and the remaining\nninety-three pounds can be sold at the original cost. This silver can be\nextracted only by the elixir of black eyes. The green eyes of barbarians\nare of no use.'--Really, what follows is too--er--obscure. But here's\nthe close: 'Tao-tais of the villages, assemble your population.\nPatriots, join! Let us hurl back these wizard-beasts beyond the oceans,\nto take their place among the strange things of creation!'\"\n\n\"And the big characters,\" she added, \"the big characters you tried to\nhide, are 'Kill' and 'Burn'?\"\n\nGray eyes and dark eyes met steadily, while the last match, reddening\nthe blood in his fingers, slowly burned out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nKAU FAI\n\nAt the top of the nunnery stairs, Rudolph met them with awkward\nceremony, and with that smiling air of encouragement which a nurse might\nuse in trying cheerfully to deceive a sick man. Heywood laughed, without\nmercy, at this pious fraud.\n\n\"Hallo, you Red-Bristled Ghost!\" he cried. \"We came early--straight from\nour walk. Are the rest coming? And did my cook arrive to help yours?\"\n\nTheir host, carried by assault, at once became less mournful.\n\n\"The cook is here,\" he replied, \"by the kitchen-sounds. They disagree, I\nthink. I have asked everybody. We should have a full dinner-table.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said his friend; and then whispering, as they followed Miss\nDrake to the living-room, \"I say, don't act as though you expected the\nghost of Banquo.\"\n\nIn the bare, white loft, by candle-light, Sturgeon sat midway in some\nlong and wheezy tale, to which the padre and his wife listened with true\nforbearance. Greetings over, the stodgy annalist continued. The story\nwas forgotten as soon as ended; talk languished; and even by the quaking\nlight of the candles, it was plain that the silence was no mere waiting\nsolemnity before meat, but a period of tension.\n\nThe relief came oddly. Up from the road sounded a hubbub of voices, the\ntramp of feet, and loud halloos.\n\n\"By Jove!\" cried Sturgeon, like a man who fears the worst; and for all\nhis bulk, he was first at the window.\n\nA straggling file of lanterns, borne by some small army, came jogging\nand crowding to a halt under the walls. Yellow faces gleamed faintly,\nbare heads bobbed, and men set down burdens, grunting. Among the\nvanguard an angry voice scolded in a strange tongue. \"_Burra suar!_\" it\nraged; then hailed imperiously, \"_Ko hai?_\"\n\nWhere the lanterns clustered brightest, an active little figure in white\nwaved a helmet, crying,--\n\n\"On deck! Where the devil does Maurice Heywood live?\"\n\n\"I'm up here,\" called that young man.\n\nFor reply, the stranger began to skip among his cohorts, jerking out his\nwhite legs like a dancing marionette. Then, with a sudden drop-kick, he\nsent the helmet flickering high into the darkness over the wall.\n\n\"Here we come!\" he shouted, in hilarious warning. The squabbling\nretinue surged after him through the gate, and one by one the lanterns\ndisappeared under the covered way.\n\n\"It's the captain!\" laughed Heywood, in amazement. \"Kneebone--ashore! He\ncan't be sober!\"\n\nAll stared; for Captain Kneebone, after one historically brief and\noutspoken visit, had never in all these years set foot in the port. The\ntwo young men hurried to the stairs.\n\nChinamen and lanterns crowded the courtyard, stuffed the passage, and\nstill came straggling in at the gate. By the noise and clatter, it might\nhave been a caravan, or a band of half-naked robbers bringing plunder.\nEverywhere, on the stone flags, coolies were dumping down bundles,\nboxes, jute-bags crammed with heavy objects. Among them, still brawling\nin bad Hindustani, the little captain gave his orders. At sight of\nHeywood, however, he began once more to caper, with extravagant\ngrimaces. By his smooth, ruddy face, and tunic of purest white, he\nseemed a runaway parson gone farther wrong than ever.\n\n\"I've come to stay a month!\" he cried; and dancing up, caught Heywood's\nhands and whirled him about. \"I was fair bursting to see ye, my boy! And\nhere we are, at last!\"\n\nThough his cheeks were flushed, and eyes alarmingly bright, he was\nbeyond question sober. Over his head, Heywood and Rudolph exchanged an\nanxious glance.\n\n\"Good! but this is Hackh's house--the nunnery,\" said the one; and the\nother added, \"You're just in time for dinner.\"\n\nThe captain found these facts to be excruciating. He clapped Rudolph on\nthe arm, and crowed:--\n\n\"Nunnery? We'll make it a bloomin' chummery!--Dinner be 'anged! A\nbanquet. What's more, I've brought the chow\"--he swept the huddled boxes\nwith a prodigal gesture,--\"lashin's o' food and drink! That's what it\nis: a banquet!\"\n\nHe turned again to his sweating followers, and flung the head coolie a\nhandful of silver, crying, \"_Sub-log kiswasti!_ Divide, and be off with\nye! _Jao_, ye beggars! Not a pice more. Finish! I'll not spend it all on\n_you_!\" Then, pouncing on the nearest crate, he burst it open with a\nferocious kick. \"Stores? The choicest to be 'ad in all Saigong! Look\nhere\"--He held up a tin and scanned the label triumphantly: \"Chow de\nBruxelles, what? Never saw chow spelt with an 'x' before, did ye?\nFrench, my boy. Bad spellers, but good cooks, are the French.\"\n\nHeywood lost his worried frown. Something had happened,--evidently at\nCalcutta, for the captain always picked up his vernacular where he\ndropped his latest cargo; but at all events these vagaries were not the\neffect of heat or loneliness.\n\n\"What's up, Captain?\" he laughed.\n\nBut now that the coolies had gone, Captain Kneebone's heels were busy,\nstaving open boxes right and left. A bottle rolled out, and smashed in a\nhissing froth of champagne.\n\n\"Plenty more,\" he cried, rejoicing. \"That shows ye how much _I_ care!\nOho!\" Suddenly he turned from this destruction, and facing Heywood,\nbegan mysteriously to exult over him. \"Old fool and his earnings, eh?\nFixed ideas, eh? 'No good,' says you. 'That cock won't fight,' says you.\n'Let it alone.'--Ho-ho! What price fixed ideas now?\"\n\nThe eyes of his young friend widened in unbelief.\n\n\"No,\" he cried, with a start: \"you haven't?\"\n\nThe captain seized both hands again, and took on--for his height--a\nRoman stateliness.\n\n\"I have.\" He nodded solemnly. \"Bar sells, I have. No more, now.\nWe'll--be-George, we'll announce it, at the banquet! Announce, that's\nthe word. First time in _my_ life: announce!\"\n\nHeywood suddenly collapsed on a sack, and laughed himself into abject\nsilence.\n\n\"Awfully glad, old chap,\" he at last contrived to say, and again\nchoked. The captain looked down at the shaking body with a singular,\nbenign, and fatherly smile.\n\n\"A funny world, ain't it?\" he declared sagely. \"I've known this boy a\nlong time,\" he explained to Rudolph. \"This matter's--We'll let you in,\npresently. Lend me some coolies here, while we turn your dinner into my\nbanquet. Eh? You don't care? Once in a bloomin' lifetime.\"\n\nWith a seafaring bellow, he helped Rudolph to hail the servants'\nquarters. A pair of cooks, a pair of Number Twos, and all the\n\"learn-pidgin\" youngsters of two households came shuffling into the\ncourt; and arriving guests found all hands broaching cargo, in a loud\nconfusion of orders and miscomprehension.\n\nThe captain's dinner was the more brilliant. Throughout the long, white\nroom, in the slow breeze of the punkah, scores of candles burned soft\nand tremulous, as though the old days had returned when the brown\nsisters lighted their refectory; but never had their table seen such\nprofusion of viands, or of talk and laughter. The Saigon stores--after\ndaily fare--seemed of a strange and Corinthian luxury. The captain's\nwine proved excellent. And his ruddy little face, beaming at the head of\nthe table, wore an extravagant, infectious grin. His quick blue eyes\ndanced with the light of some ineffable joke. He seemed a conjurer,\ncreating banquets for sheer mischief in the wilderness.\n\n\"There's a soup!\" he had proclaimed. \"Patent, mind ye! Stick a knife\ninto the tin, and she 'eats 'erself!\"\n\nAmong all the revelers, one face alone showed melancholy. Chantel, at\nthe foot of the table, sat unregarded by all save Rudolph, who now and\nthen caught from him a look filled with gloom and suspicion. It was\nbeside Rudolph that Mrs. Forrester laughed and chattered, calling all\neyes toward her, and yet finding private intervals in which to dart a\nsidelong shaft at her neighbor. Rudolph's ears shone coral pink; for now\nagain he was aboard ship, hiding a secret at once dizzy, dangerous, and\nentrancing. Across the talk, the wine, the many lights, came the triumph\nof seeing that other hostile face, glowering in defeat. Never before had\nChantel, and all the others, dwindled so far into such nonentity, or her\npresence vibrated so near.\n\nSoon he became aware that Captain Kneebone had risen, with a face\nglowing red above the candles. Even Sturgeon forgot the flood of\nbounties, and looked expectantly toward their source. The captain\ncleared his throat, faltered, then turning sheepish all at once,\nhung his head.\n\n\"Be 'anged, I can't make a speech, after all,\" he grumbled; and\nwheeling suddenly on Heywood, with a peevish air of having been\ndefrauded: \"Aboard ship I could sit and think up no end o' flowery talk,\nand now it's all gone!\"\n\nHe stared at his plate miserably. It was Miss Drake who came to his\nrescue.\n\n\"Tell us the secret,\" she begged. \"How do you manage all these nice\nthings?\"\n\nThe captain's eyes surveyed the motley collection down the length of the\nbright table, then returned to her, gratefully:--\n\n\"This ain't anything. Only a little--bloomin'--\"\n\n\"Impromptu,\" suggested Heywood.\n\n\"That's the word!\" Captain Kneebone eyed them both with uncommon favor.\n\"That's it, ye know. I just 'opped about Saigong like a--jackdaw,\npicking up these impromptus. But I came here all the way to break the\nnews proper, by word o' mouth.\"\n\nHe faced the company, and gathering himself for the effort,--\n\n\"I'm rich,\" he declared. \"I'm da--I'm remarkable rich.\"\n\nPausing for the effect, he warmed to his oratory.\n\n\"It ain't for me to boast. Sailormen as a rule are bad hands to save\nmoney. But I've won first prize in the Derby Sweepstake Lott'ry, and the\nmoney's safe to my credit at the H.K. and S. in Calcutta, and I'm\nretired and going Home! More money than the old Kut Sing earned since\nher launching--so much I was frightened, first, and lost my sleep! And\nme without chick nor child, as the saying is--to go Home and live\nluxurious ever after!\"\n\n\"Ow!\" cried Nesbit, \"lucky beggar!\"--\"Sincerely glad,\" said Mr.\nForrester. And a volley of compliments went round the board. The captain\nplainly took heart, and flushing still redder at so much praise and good\nwill, stood now at ease, chuckling.\n\n\"Most men,\" he began, when there came a lull, \"most men makes a will\nafter they're dead. That's a shore way o' doing things! Now _I_ want to\nsee the effects, living. So be 'anged, here goes, right and proper. To\nMiss Drake, for her hospital and kiddies, two thousand rupees.\"\n\nIn the laughter and friendly uproar, the girl sat dazed.\n\n\"What shall I say?\" she whispered, wavering between amusement and\ndistress. \"I can't accept it--\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" grumbled Heywood, with an angry glance. \"Don't spoil the\nhappiest evening of an old man's life.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" she answered quickly; and when the plaudits ended, she\nthanked the captain in a very simple, pretty speech, which made him\nduck and grin,--a proud little benefactor.\n\n\"That ain't all,\" he cried gayly; then leveled a threatening finger,\nlike a pistol, at her neighbor. \"Who poked fun at me, first and last?\nWho always came out aboard to tell me what an old ass I was? Fixed\nideas, eh? No go?--Look you here. What did I come so many hundred miles\nfor? To say what I always said: half-shares.\" The light-blue eyes, keen\nwith sea-cunning and the lonely sight of many far horizons, suffered an\nindescribable change. \"My boy, the half's yours. There's two rich men\nhere to-night. I've come to take you Home.\"\n\nIt was Heywood's turn to be struck dumb. He grew very pale.\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" he stammered at last, \"it's not fair--\"\n\n\"Don't spoil the happiest evening--\" whispered the girl beside him.\n\nHe eyed her ruefully, groaned, then springing up, went swiftly to the\nhead of the table and wrung the captain's brown paw, without a word\nto say.\n\n\"Can do, can do,\" said Captain Kneebone, curtly. \"I was afraid ye might\nnot want to come.\"\n\nThen followed a whirlwind; and Teppich rose with his moustache\nbristling, and the ready Nesbit jerked him down again in the opening\nsentence; and everybody laughed at Heywood, who sat there so white,\nwith such large eyes; and the dinner going by on the wings of night, the\nmelancholy \"boy\" circled the table, all too soon, with a new silver\ncasket full of noble cigars from Paiacombo, Manila, and Dindigul.\n\nAs the three ladies passed the foot of the table, Rudolph saw Mrs.\nForrester make an angry signal. And presently, like a prisoner going to\nhis judge, Chantel slipped out of the room. He was not missed; for\nalready the streaming candle-flames stood wreathed in blue layers, nor\nwas it long before the captain, mounting his chair, held a full\nglass aloft.\n\n\"Here,\" he cried in triumph, \"here's to every nail in the hoof--\"\n\nThe glass crashed into splinters and froth. A flying stone struck the\nboom of the punkah, and thumped on the table. Through the open windows,\nfrom the road, came a wild chorus of yells, caught up and echoed by many\nvoices in the distance.\n\n\"Shutters!\" called Heywood. \"Quick!\"\n\nAs they slammed them home, more stones drummed on the boards and\nclattered against the wall. Conches brayed somewhere, followed by an\nunaccountable, sputtering fusillade as of tiny muskets, and then by a\nformidable silence. While the banqueters listened in the smoky room,\nthere came a sullen, heavy sound, like a single stroke on a large and\nvery slack bass-drum.\n\n\"_Kau fai!_\" shrilled the voices below; and then in a fainter gabble, as\nthough hurrying off toward the sound,--\"_kau fai!_\"\n\n\"The Black Dog,\" said Heywood, quietly. \"He has barked. Earlier than we\nfigured, Gilly. Lucky the scaffolding's up. Gentlemen, we all know our\nposts. Guns are in the first bedroom. Quietly, now. Rudie, go call\nChantel. Don't frighten the women. If they ask about that noise, tell\n'em anything--Dragon Boat Festival beginning. Anything.--We can easily\nhold this place, while the captain gets 'em out to his ship.\"\n\nThe captain wheeled, with an injured air.\n\n\"What ship?\" he inquired testily. \"Told ye, plain, I was retired. Came\nthe last bit in a stinking native boat, and _she's_ cleared by now.\nThink I carry ships in my pocket?\"\n\nOutside, the swollen discord of shouts, thunder of gongs, and hoarse\ncalling of the conches came slowly nearer, extending through\nthe darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nTHE GUNWALE\n\nRudolph's mission began quietly, with a glimpse which he afterward\nrecalled as incredibly peaceful. Two of the women, at least, showed no\nfear. In the living-room sat Mrs. Earle, her chin cramped on her high\nbosom, while she mournfully studied his  picture-book of the\nRhine. Miss Drake, who leaned in one of the river windows, answered him,\nsaying rather coldly that Chantel and Mrs. Forrester had gone down to\nthe garden.\n\nIn the court, however, he ran across Ah Pat, loitering beside a lantern.\nThe compradore grinned, and in a tone of great unconcern called out that\nthe pair were not in the garden. \"Walkee so.\" He pointed down the\npassage to the main gate, and hooked his thumb toward the right, to\nindicate their course. \"Makee finish, makee die now,\" he added calmly;\n\"too muchee, no can.\"\n\nRudolph experienced his first shock of terror, like an icy blow on the\nscalp. They had gone outside before the alarm; she, Bertha, was swept\naway in that tumult which came raging through the darkness.--He stood\ntransfixed, but only for an instant, rather by the stroke of\nhelplessness than by fear; and then, blindly, without plan or foresight,\ndarted down the covered way. The tiny flame of a pith wick, floating in\na saucer of oil, showed Heywood's gatekeeper sitting at his post, like a\ngnome in the gallery of a mine. Rudolph tore away the bar, heard the\nheavy gate slam shut, and found himself running down the starlit road.\n\nNot all starlight, however; a dim red glow began to flicker on the\nshapes which rushed behind him in his flight. Wheeling once, he saw two\nbroad flames leaping high in wild and splendid rivalry,--one from\nHeywood's house, one from the club. He caught also a whirling impression\nof many heads and arms, far off, tiny, black, and crowded in rushing\ndisorder; of pale torches in the road; and of a hissing, snarling shout,\na single word, like \"_Sha, sha_!\" repeated incessantly in a high key.\nThe flame at the club shot up threefold, with a crash; and a glorious\ncriss-cross multitude of sparks flew hissing through the treetops, like\nfiery tadpoles through a net.\n\nHe turned and ran on, dazzled; fell over some one who lay groaning; rose\non hands and knees, groped in the dust, and suddenly fingered thin,\nrough cloth, warm and sopping. In a nausea of relief, he felt that this\nwas a native,--some unknown dying man, who coughed like a drunkard.\n\nRudolph sprang up and raced again, following by habit the path which he\nand she had traversed at noon. Once, with a heavy collision, he stopped\nshort violently in the midst of crowded men, who shouted, clung to him,\nwrestling, and struck out with something sharp that ripped his tunic. He\nkicked, shook them off, hammered his fists right and left, and ran free,\nwith a strange conviction that to-night he was invincible. Stranger\nstill, as the bamboo leaves now and then brushed his bare forehead, he\nmissed the sharp music of her cicadas.\n\nThe looming of a wall checked him. Here stood her house; she had the\nbriefest possible start of him, and he had run headlong the whole way;\nby all the certainty of instinct, he knew that he had chosen the right\npath: why, then, had he not overtaken her? If she met that band which he\nhad just broken through--He wavered in the darkness, and was turning\nwildly to race back, when a sudden light sprang up before him in her\nwindow. He plunged forward, in at the gate, across a plot of turf,\nstumbled through the Goddess of Mercy bamboo that hedged the door, and\nwent falling up the dark stairs, crying aloud,--for the first time in\nhis life,--\"Bertha! Bertha!\"\n\nEmpty rooms rang with the name, but no one answered. At last, however,\nreaching the upper level, he saw by lamplight, through the open door,\ntwo figures struggling. Just before he entered, she tore herself free\nand went unsteadily across the room. Chantel, white and abject, turned\nas in panic.\n\n\"Oh!\" Plainly he had not expected to see another face as white as his\nown. Breathless and trembling, he spoke in a strangely little voice; but\nhis staring eyes lighted with a sudden and desperate resolution. \"Help\nme with her,\" he begged. \"She won't listen. The woman's out of\nher wits.\"\n\nHe caught Rudolph by the arm; and standing for a moment like close\nfriends, the two panting rivals watched her in stupefaction. She\nransacked a great cedar chest, a table, shelves, boxes, and strewed the\ncontents on the floor,--silk scarfs, shining Benares brass, Chinese\nsilver, vivid sarongs from the Preanger regency, Kyoto cloisonne, a wild\nheap of plunder from the bazaars of all the nations where Gilly's meagre\nearnings had been squandered. A Cingalese box dropped and burst open,\nscattering bright stones, false or precious, broadcast. She trampled\nthem in her blind and furious search.\n\n\"Come,\" said Chantel, and snatched at her. \"Leave those. Come to the\nboat. Every minute--\"\n\nShe pushed him aside like a thing without weight or meaning, stooped\nagain among the gay rubbish, caught up a necklace, flung it down for\nthe sake of a brooch, then dropped everything and turned with blank,\ndilated eyes, and the face of a child lost in a crowd.\n\n\"Rudolph,\" she whimpered, \"help me. What shall I do?\"\n\nWithout waiting for answer, she bent once more to sort and discard her\npitiful treasures, to pause vaguely, consider, and wring her hands.\nRudolph, in his turn, caught her by the arm, but fared no better.\n\n\"We must humor her,\" whispered Chantel, and, kneeling like a peddler\namong the bazaar-stuffs, spread on the floor a Java sarong, blue and\nbrown, painted with men and buffaloes. On this he began to heap things\npell-mell.\n\nThe woman surrendered, and all at once flung her arms about Rudolph,\nhiding her face, and clinging to him as if with the last of\nher strength.\n\n\"Come, he'll bring them,\" she sobbed. \"Let's go--to the boat. He must\nfind his own way. Take me.\" Hurry and fright choked her. \"Take me--leave\nhim, if he won't come--I scolded him--then the noises came, and\nwe ran--\"\n\n\"What boat?\" said Rudolph.\n\nChantel did not look up.\n\n\"I have one ready and stocked,\" he mumbled, tugging with his teeth at\nthe knot in the sarong corners. \"You can come. We'll drop down the\nriver, and try it along the coast. Only chance. Come on.\"\n\nHe rose, and started for the door, slinging the bright- bundle\nover his shoulder. \"Come on,\" he snarled. Against the gay pattern, his\nhandsome pirate face shone brown and evil in the lamplight. \"Damn you,\nI've waited long enough for your whims. Stay there and be killed, then.\"\n\nHe ran to the stairs, and down. The woman's arms began to drag loosely,\nas if she were slipping to the floor; then suddenly, with a cry, she\nturned and bolted. Run as he might, Rudolph did not overtake her till\nshe had caught Chantel at the gate. All three, silent, sped across\nfields toward the river, through the startling shadows and dim orange\nglow from distant flames.\n\nThe rough ground sloped, at last, and sent them stumbling down into mud.\nBehind them the bank ran black and ragged against the glow; before them,\nstill more black, lay the river, placid, mysterious, and safe. Through\nthe mud they labored heavily toward a little, smoky light--a lantern\ngleaming faintly on a polished gunwale, the shoulders of a man, and the\nthin, slant line that was his pole.\n\n\"Lowdah?\" called Chantel; and the shoulders moved, the line shifted, as\nthe boatman answered. Chantel pitched the bundle over the lantern, and\nleapt on board. Rudolph came slowly, carrying in his arms the woman,\nwho lay quiet and limp, clasping him in a kind of drowsy oblivion. He\nfelt the flutter of her lips, while she whispered in his ear strange,\nbreathless entreaties, a broken murmur of endearments, unheard-of, which\ntempted him more than the wide, alluring darkness of the river.\n\nHe lowered her slowly; and leaning against the gunwale, she still clung\nto his hands.\n\n\"Aboard! Quickly!\" snapped their leader, from the dusk behind the\nlantern.\n\nObeying by impulse, Rudolph moved nearer the gunwale. The slippery edge,\npolished by bare feet through many years, seemed the one bit of reality\nin this dream, except the warmth of her hands.\n\n\"To the nunnery?\" he asked, trying dully to rouse from a fascination.\n\n\"No, no,\" she wailed. \"Down--away--safe.\"\n\n\"No, back to them,\" he answered stupidly. \"They are all there. Your--he\nis there. We can't leave--\"\n\n\"You fool!\" Chantel swore in one tongue, and in another cried to the\nboatman--\"Shove off, if they won't come!\" He seized the woman roughly\nand pulled her on board; but she reached out and caught Rudolph's\nhand again.\n\n\"Come, hurry,\" she whispered, tugging at him. \"Come, dear boy. I won't\nleave you. Quickly. You saw it burning. They're all dead. It's no use.\nWe must live. We must live, darling.\"\n\nShe was right, somehow; there was no power to confute her. He must come\nwith her, or run back, useless, into the ring of swords and flames. She\nand life were in the boat; ashore, a friend cut off beyond reach, an\nimpossible duty, and death. His eyes, dull and fixed in the smoky\nlantern-light, rested for an age on the knotted sarong. It meant\nnothing; then in a flash, as though for him all light of the eyes had\nconcentrated in a single vision, it meant everything. The \ncloth--rudely painted in the hut of some forgotten mountaineer--held\nall her treasure and her heart, the things of this world. She must go\nwith those. It was fitting. She was beautiful--in all her fear and\ndisorder, still more beautiful. She went with life, departing into a\ndream. This glossy gunwale, polished by bare feet, was after all the\nsole reality, a shining line between life and death.\n\n\"Then I must die,\" he groaned, and wrenched his hands away from that\nperilous boundary.\n\nHe vaguely heard her cry out, vaguely saw Chantel rise above the lantern\nand slash down at him with the lowdah's pole. The bamboo struck him,\nheavy but glancing, on the head. He staggered, lost his footing, and\nfell into the mud, where, as though his choice had already overtaken\nhim, he lay without thought or emotion, watching the dim light float off\ninto the darkness.\n\nBy and by it was gone. From somewhere in another direction came a sharp,\ncontinual, crackling fusillade, like the snapping of dry bamboo-joints\nin a fire. The unstirring night grew heavier with the smell of burnt\ngunpowder. But Rudolph, sitting in the mud, felt only that his eyes were\ndry and leaden in their sockets, that there was a drumming in his ears,\nand that if heat and weariness thus made an end of him, he need no\nlonger watch the oppressive multitude of stars, or hear the monotony of\nflowing water.\n\nSomething stirred in the dry grass above him. Without turning, he heard\na man scramble down the bank; without looking up, he felt some one pause\nand stoop close. When at last, in profound apathy, he raised his eyes,\nhe saw against the starlight the hat, head, and shoulders of a coolie.\n\nQuite natural, he thought, that the fellow should be muttering in\nGerman. It was only the halting, rusty fashion of the speech that\nfinally fretted him into listening. The words did not concern him.\n\n\"Are you dead, then?\" grumbled the coolie. \"Did she kill you?\"\n\nRudolph dismissed him with a vague but angry motion.\n\nSome time afterward the same voice came louder. The coolie was still\nthere.\n\n\"You cannot sit here all night,\" he said. \"By daylight they will catch\nyou. Come. Perhaps I can take you to your friends. Come.\"\n\nRudolph felt sharp knuckles working at his lips, and before he could\nrebel, found his mouth full of sweet fiery liquid. He choked, swallowed,\nand presently heard the empty bottle splash in the river.\n\n\"_Stoesst an_!\" said the rescuer, and chuckled something in dispraise of\nwomen. \"Is that not better?\"\n\nThe rice-brandy was hot and potent; for of a sudden Rudolph found\nhimself afoot and awake. A dizzy warmth cleared his spirit. He\nunderstood perfectly. This man, for some strange reason, was Wutzler, a\ncoolie and yet a brother from the fatherland. He and his nauseous alien\nbrandy had restored the future. There was more to do.\n\n\"Come on.\" The forsaken lover was first man up the bank. \"See!\" he\ncried, pointing to a new flare in the distance. The whole region was now\naglow like a furnace, and filled with smoke, with prolonged yells, and a\ncontinuity of explosions that ripped the night air like tearing silk.\n\"Her house is burning now.\"\n\n\"You left in time.\" Wutzler shuffled before him, with the trot of a\nlean and exhausted laborer. \"I was with the men you fought, when you\nran. I followed to the house, and then here, to the river. I was glad\nyou did not jump on board.\" He glanced back, timidly, for approbation.\n\"I am a great coward, Herr Heywood told me so,--but I also stay\nand help.\"\n\nHe steered craftily among the longest and blackest shadows, now jogging\nin a path, now threading the boundary of a rice-field, or waiting behind\ntrees; and all the time, though devious and artful as a deer-stalker,\ncrept toward the centre of the noise and the leaping flames. When the\nquaking shadows grew thin and spare, and the lighted clearings\ndangerously wide, he swerved to the right through a rolling bank of\nsmoke. They coughed as they ran.\n\nOnce Rudolph paused, with the heat of the fire on his cheeks.\n\n\"The nunnery is burning,\" he said hopelessly.\n\nHis guide halted, peered shrewdly, and listened.\n\n\"No, they are still shooting,\" he answered, and limped onward, skirting\nthe uproar.\n\nAt last, when by pale stars above the smoke and flame and sparks,\nRudolph judged that they were somewhere north of the nunnery, they came\nstumbling down into a hollow encumbered with round, swollen obstacles.\nLike a patch of enormous melons, oil-jars lay scattered.\n\n\"Hide here, and wait,\" commanded Wutzler. \"I will go see.\" And he\nflitted off through the smoke.\n\nSmuggled among the oil-jars, Rudolph lay panting. Shapes of men ran\npast, another empty jar rolled down beside him, and a stray bullet sang\noverhead like a vibrating wire. Soon afterward, Wutzler came crawling\nthrough the huddled pottery.\n\n\"Lie still,\" he whispered. \"Your friends are hemmed in. You cannot get\nthrough.\"\n\nThe smell of rancid oil choked them, yet they could breathe without\ncoughing, and could rest their smarting eyes. In the midst of tumult and\ncombustion, the hollow lay dark as a pool. Along its rim bristled a\nscrubby fringe of weeds, black against a rosy cloud.\n\nAfter a time, something still blacker parted the weeds. In silhouette, a\nman's head, his hand grasping a staff or the muzzle of a gun, remained\nthere as still as though, crawling to the verge, he lay petrified in the\nact of spying.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nLAMP OF HEAVEN\n\nThe white men peered from among the oil-jars, like two of the Forty\nThieves. They could detect no movement, friendly or hostile: the black\nhead lodged there without stirring. The watcher, whether he had seen\nthem or not, was in no hurry; for with chin propped among the weeds, he\nheld a pose at once alert and peaceful, mischievous and leisurely, as\nthough he were master of that hollow, and might lie all night drowsing\nor waking, as the humor prompted.\n\nWutzler pressed his face against the earth, and shivered in the stifling\nheat. The uncertainty grew, with Rudolph, into an acute distress. His\nlegs ached and twitched, the bones of his neck were stretched as if to\nbreak, and a corner of broken clay bored sharply between his ribs. He\nfelt no fear, however: only a great impatience to have the spy\nbegin,--rise, beckon, call to his fellows, fire his gun, hit or miss.\n\nThis longing, or a flash of anger, or the rice-brandy working so nimbly\nin his wits, gave him both impulse and plan.\n\n\"Don't move,\" he whispered; \"wait here.\" And wriggling backward, inch\nby inch, feet foremost among the crowded bellies of the jars, he gained\nthe further darkness. So far as sight would carry, the head stirred no\nmore than if it had been a cannon-ball planted there on the verge,\nagainst the rosy cloud. From crawling, Rudolph rose to hands and knees,\nand silently in the dust began to creep on a long circuit. Once, through\na rift in smoke, he saw a band of yellow musketeers, who crouched behind\nsome ragged earthwork or broken wall, loading and firing without pause\nor care, chattering like outraged monkeys, and all too busy to spare a\nglance behind. Their heads bobbed up and down in queer scarlet turbans\nor scarfs, like the flannel nightcaps of so many diabolic invalids.\n\nPassing them unseen, he crept back toward his hollow. In spite of smoke,\nhe had gauged and held his circle nicely, for straight ahead lay the\nman's legs. Taken thus in the rear, he still lay prone, staring down the\n<DW72>, inactive; yet legs, body, and the bent arm that clutched a musket\nbeside him in the grass, were stiff with some curious excitement. He\nseemed ready to spring up and fire.\n\nNo time to lose, thought Rudolph; and rising, measured his distance with\na painful, giddy exactness. He would have counted to himself before\nleaping, but his throat was too dry. He flinched a little, then shot\nthrough the air, and landed heavily, one knee on each side, pinning the\nfellow down as he grappled underneath for the throat. Almost in the same\nmovement he had bounded on foot again, holding both hands above his\nhead, as high as he could withdraw them. The body among the weeds lay\ncold, revoltingly indifferent to stratagem or violence, in the same\ntense attitude, which had nothing to do with life.\n\nRudolph dropped his hands, and stood confounded by his own brutal\ndiscourtesy. Wutzler, crawling out from the jars, scrambled joyfully\nup the bank.\n\n\"You have killed him?\" quavered the dry little voice. \"You are very\nbrave!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Rudolph, earnestly. \"He was, already.\"\n\nBy the scarlet headgear, and a white symbol on the back of his jacket,\nthe man at their feet was one of the musketeers. He had left the\nfiring-line, crawled away in the dark, and found a quiet spot to die in.\n\n\"So! This is good luck!\" Wutzler doffed his coolie hat, slid out of his\njacket, tossed both down among the oil-jars, and stooping over the dead\nman, began to untwist the scarlet turban. In the dim light his lean arms\nand frail body, coated with black hair, gave him the look of a puny ape\nrobbing a sleeper. He wriggled into the dead man's jacket, wound the\nblood-red cloth about his own temples, and caught up musket, ramrod,\npowder-horn, and bag of bullets.--\"Now I am all safe,\" he chuckled. \"Now\nI can go anywhere, to-night.\"\n\nHe shouldered arms and stood grinning as though all their troubles were\nended.\n\n\"So! I am rebel soldier. We try again; come.--Not too close behind me;\nand if I speak, run back.\"\n\nIn this order they began once more to scout through the smoke. No one\nmet them, though distant shapes rushed athwart the gloom, yelping to\neach other, and near by, legs of runners moved under a rolling cloud of\nsmoke as if their bodies were embedded and swept along in the\nwrack:--all confused, hurried, and meaningless, like the uproar of\ngongs, horns, conches, whistling bullets, crackers, and squibs that\nsputtering, string upon string, flower upon rising flower of misty red\ngold explosion, ripped all other noise to tatters.\n\nWhere and how he followed, Rudolph never could have told; but once, as\nthey ran slinking through the heaviest smoke and, as it seemed, the\nheart of the turmoil, he recognized the yawning rim of a clay-pit, not a\nstone's throw from his own gate. It was amazing to feel that safety lay\nso close; still more amazing to catch a glimpse of many coolies digging\nin the pit by torchlight, peacefully, as though they had heard of no\ndisturbance that evening. Hardly had the picture flashed past, than he\nwondered whether he had seen or imagined it, whose men they were, and\nwhy, even at any time, they should swarm so busy, thick as ants, merely\nto dig clay.\n\nHe had worry enough, however, to keep in view the white cross-barred\nhieroglyphic on his guide's jacket. Suddenly it vanished, and next\ninstant the muzzle of the gun jolted against his ribs.\n\n\"Run, quick,\" panted Wutzler, pushing him aside. \"To the left, into the\ngo-down. Here they are!--To your left!\" And with the words, he bounded\noff to the right, firing his gun to confuse the chase.\n\nRudolph obeyed, and, running at top speed, dimly understood that he had\ndoubled round a squad of grunting runners, whose bare feet pattered\nclose by him in the smoke. Before him gaped a black square, through\nwhich he darted, to pitch head first over some fat, padded bulk. As he\nrose, the rasping of rough jute against his cheek told him that he had\nfallen among bales; and a familiar, musty smell, that the bales were his\nown, in his own go-down, across a narrow lane from the nunnery. With\nhigh hopes, he stumbled farther into the darkness. Once, among the\nbales, he trod on a man's hand, which was silently pulled away. With no\ntime to think of that, he crawled and climbed over the disordered heaps,\ngroping toward the other door. He had nearly reached it, when torchlight\nflared behind him, rushing in, and savage cries, both shrill and\nguttural, rang through the stuffy warehouse. He had barely time, in the\nreeling shadows, to fall on the earthen floor, and crawl under a thin\ncurtain of reeds to a new refuge.\n\nInto this--a cubby-hole where the compradore kept his tally-slips,\numbrella, odds and ends--the torchlight shone faintly through the reeds.\nLying flat behind a roll of matting, Rudolph could see, as through the\ngauze twilight of a stage scene, the tossing lights and the skipping men\nwho shouted back and forth, jabbing their spears or pikes down among the\nbales, to probe the darkness. Their search was wild but thorough. Before\nit, in swift retreat, some one crawled past the compradore's room,\nbrushing the splint partition like a snake. This, as Rudolph guessed,\nmight be the man whose hand he had stepped on.\n\nThe stitches in the curtain became beads of light. A shadowy arm heaved\nup, fell with a dry, ripping sound and a vertical flash. A sword had cut\nthe reeds from top to bottom.\n\nThrough the rent a smoking flame plunged after the sword, and after\nboth, a bony yellow face that gleamed with sweat. Rudolph, half wrapped\nin his matting, could see the hard, glassy eyes shine cruelly in their\nnarrow slits; but before they lowered to meet his own, a jubilant yell\nresounded in the go-down, and with a grunt, the yellow face, the\nflambeau, and the sword were snatched away.\n\nHe lay safe, but at the price of another man's peril. They had caught\nthe crawling fugitive, and now came dragging him back to the lights.\nThrough the tattered curtain Rudolph saw him flung on the ground like an\nempty sack, while his captors crowded about in a broken ring, cackling,\nand prodding him with their pikes. Some jeered, some snarled, others\ncalled him by name, with laughing epithets that rang more friendly, or\nat least more jocular; but all bent toward him eagerly, and flung down\nquestion after question, like a little band of kobolds holding an\ninquisition. At some sharper cry than the rest, the fellow rose to his\nknees and faced them boldly. A haggard Christian, he was being fairly\ngiven his last chance to recant.\n\n\"Open your mouth! Open your mouth!\" they cried, in rage or entreaty.\n\nThe kneeling captive shook his head, and made some reply, very distinct\nand simple.\n\n\"Open your mouth!\" They struck at him with the torches. The same sword\nthat had slashed the curtain now pricked his naked chest. Rudolph,\nclenching his fists in a helpless longing to rush out and scatter all\nthese men-at-arms, had a strange sense of being transported into the\npast, to watch with ghostly impotence a mediaeval tragedy.\n\nThe kneeling man repeated his unknown declaration. His round, honest,\noily face was anything but heroic, and wore no legendary, transfiguring\nlight. He seemed rather stupid than calm; yet as he mechanically wound\nhis queue into place once more above the shaven forehead, his fingers\nmoved surely and deftly. Not once did they slip or tremble.\n\n\"Open your mouth!\" snarled the pikemen and the torch-bearers, with the\nfierce gestures of men who have wasted time and patience.\n\n\"The Lamp of Heaven!\" bawled the swordsman, beside himself. \"Give him\nthe Lamp of Heaven!\"\n\nTo the others, this phrase acted as a spark to powder.\n\n\"Good! good!\" they shrilled, nodding furiously. \"The Lamp of Heaven!\"\nAnd several men began to rummage and overhaul the chaos of the go-down.\nRudolph had given orders, that afternoon, to remove all necessary stores\nto the nunnery. But from somewhere in the darkness, one rioter brought a\nsack of flour, while another flung down a tin case of petroleum. The\nsword had no sooner cut the sack across and punctured the tin, than a\nfat villain in a loin cloth, squatting on the earthen floor, kneaded\nflour and oil into a grimy batch of dough.\n\n\"Will you speak out and live,\" cried the swordsman, \"or will you die?\"\n\nFor a second the Christian did not stir. Then, as though the option were\nnot in his power,--\n\n\"Die,\" he answered.\n\nThe fat baker sprang up, and clapped on the obstinate head a shapeless\ngray turban of dough. Half a dozen torches jostled for the honor of\nlighting it. The Christian, crowned with sooty flames, gave a single\ncry, clear above all the others. He was calling--as even Rudolph\nknew--on the strange god across the sea, Saviour of the Children of the\nWest, not to forget his nameless and lonely servant.\n\nRudolph groaned aloud, rose, and had parted the curtain to run out and\nfall upon them all, when suddenly, close at hand and sharp in the\ngeneral din, there burst a quick volley of rifleshots. Splinters flew\nfrom the attap walls. A torch-bearer and the man with the sword spun\nhalf round, collided, and fell, the one across the other, like drunken\nwrestlers. The survivors flung down their torches and ran, leaping and\ndiving over bales. On the ground, the smouldering Lamp of Heaven showed\nthat its wearer, rescued by a lucky bullet, lay still in a posture of\nhumility. Strange humility, it seemed, for one so suddenly given the\ncomplete and profound wisdom that confirms all faith, foreign or\ndomestic, new or old.\n\nWith a sense of all this, but no clear sense of action, Rudolph found\nthe side-door, opened it, closed it, and started across the lane. He\nknew only that he should reach the mafoo's little gate by the pony-shed,\nand step out of these dark ages into the friendly present; so that when\nsomething from the wall blazed point-blank, and he fell flat on the\nground, he lay in utter defeat, bitterly surprised and offended. His own\nfriends: they might miss him once, but not twice. Let it come quickly.\n\nInstead, from the darkness above came the most welcome sound he had ever\nknown,--a keen, high voice, scolding.\n\n\"What the devil are you firing at?\" It was Heywood, somewhere on the\nroof of the pony-shed. He put the question sharply, yet sounded cool and\ncheerful. \"A shadow? Rot! You waste another cartridge so, and I'll take\nyour gun away. Remember that!\"\n\nNesbit's voice clipped out some pert objection.\n\n\"Potted the beggar, any'ow--see for yourself--go-down 's afire.\"\n\n\"Saves us the trouble of burning it.\" The other voice moved away, with\na parting rebuke. \"No more of that, sniping and squandering. Wait till\nthey rush you.\"\n\nRudolph lifted his head from the dust.\n\n\"Maurice!\" he called feebly. \"Maurice, let me in!\"\n\n\"Hallo!\" answered his captain on the wall, blithely. \"Steady on, we'll\nget you.\"\n\nOf all hardships, this brief delay was least bearable. Then a bight of\nrope fell across Rudolph's back. He seized it, hauled taut, and planting\nhis feet against the wall, went up like a fish, to land gasping on a row\nof sand-bags.\n\n\"Ho, you wandering German!\" His invisible friend clapped him on the\nshoulder. \"By Jove, I'm glad. No time to burble now, though. Off with\nyou. Compradore has a gun for you, in the court. Collect a drink as you\ngo by. Report to Kneebone at the northeast corner. Danger point there:\nwe need a good man, so hurry. Devilish glad. Cut along.\"\n\nRudolph, scrambling down from the pony-shed, ran across the compound\nwith his head in a whirl. Yet through all the scudding darkness and\nconfusion, one fact had pierced as bright as a star. On this night of\nalarms, he had turned the great corner in his life. Like the pale\nstranger with his crown of fire, he could finish the course.\n\nHe caught his rifle from the compradore's hand, but needed no draught\nfrom any earthly cup. Brushing through the orange trees, he made for the\nnortheast angle, free of all longing perplexities, purged of all vile\nadmiration, and fit to join his friends in clean and wholesome danger.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nSIEGE\n\nHe never believed that they could hold the northeast corner for a\nminute, so loud and unceasing was the uproar. Bullets spattered sharply\nalong the wall and sang overhead, mixed now and then with an\nindescribable whistling and jingling. The angle was like the prow of a\nship cutting forward into a gale. Yet Rudolph climbed, rejoicing, up the\nshort bamboo ladder, to the platform which his coolies had built in such\nhaste, so long ago, that afternoon.\n\nHis high spirits went before a fall. As he stood up, in the full glow\nfrom the burning go-down, somebody tackled him about the knees and threw\nhim head first on the sand-bags.\n\n\"How many times must I give me orders?\" barked the little sea-captain.\n\"Under cover, under cover, and stay under cover, or I'll send ye below,\nye gallivanting--Oh! it's you, is it? Well, there's your port-hole.\" A\nstubby finger pointed in the obscurity. \"There! and don't ye fire till\nI say so!\"\n\nThus made welcome, Rudolph crawled toward a chink among the bags, ran\nthe muzzle of his gun into place, and lay ready for whatever might come\nout of the quaking lights and darknesses beyond.\n\nNothing came, however, except a swollen continuity of sound, a rolling\ncloud of noises, thick and sullen as the smell of burnt gunpowder. It\nwas strange, thought Rudolph, how nothing happened from moment to\nmoment. No yellow bodies came charging out of the hubbub. He himself lay\nthere unhurt; his fellows joked, grumbled, shifted their legs on the\nplatform. At times the heavier, duller sound, which had been the signal\nfor the whole disorder,--one ponderous beat, as on a huge and very slack\nbass-drum,--told that the Black Dog from Rotterdam was not far off. Yet\neven then there followed no shock of round-shot battering at masonry,\nbut only an access of the stormy whistling and jingling.\n\n\"Copper cash,\" declared the voice of Heywood, in a lull. By the sound,\nhe was standing on the rungs of the ladder, with his head at the level\nof the platform; also by the sound, he was enjoying himself\ninordinately. \"What a jolly good piece of luck! Scrap metal and copper\ncash. Firing money at us--like you, Captain. Just what we thought, too.\nSome unruly gang among them wouldn't wait, and forced matters. Tonight\nwas premature. The beggars have plenty of powder, and little else.\nSo far.\"\n\nRudolph listened in wonder. Here, in the thick of the fight, was a\nlight-hearted, busy commander, drawing conclusions and extracting news\nfrom chaos.\n\n\"Look out for arrows,\" continued the speaker, as he crawled to a\nloophole between Rudolph's and the captain's. \"They're shooting arrows\nup over. Killed one convert and wounded two, there by the water gate.\nThey can't get the elevation for you chaps here, though.\" And again he\nadded, cheerfully, \"So far, at least.\"\n\nThe little band behind the loopholes lay watching through the smoke,\nlistening through the noise. The Black Dog barked again, and sent a\nshower of money clinking along the wall.\n\n\"How do you like it, Rudie?\" chuckled his friend.\n\n\"It is terrible,\" answered Rudolph, honestly.\n\n\"Terrible racket, yes. Fireworks, to frighten us. Wait till their\nammunition comes; then you'll see fun. Fireworks, all this.\" Heywood\nturned to his other companion. \"I say, Kneebone, what's your idea?\nSniping all night, will it be?--or shall we get a fair chance at 'em?\"\n\nThe captain, a small, white, recumbent spectre, lifted his head and\nappeared to sniff the smoke judicially.\n\n\"They get a chance at us, more like!\" he grumbled. \"My opinion, the\nblighters have shot and burnt themselves into a state o' mind; bloomin'\ndelusion o' grandeur, that's what. Wildest of 'em will rush us to-night,\nonce--maybe twice. We stave 'em off, say: that case, they'll settle down\nto starve us, right and proper.\"\n\n\"Siege,\" assented Heywood.\n\n\"Siege, like you read about.\" The captain lay flat again. \"Wish a man\ncould smoke up here.\"\n\nHeywood laughed, and turned his head:--\n\n\"How much do you know about sieges, old chap?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Rudolph confessed.\n\n\"Nor I, worse luck. Outside of school--_testudine facia,_ that sort of\nthing. However,\" he went on cheerfully, \"we shall before long\"--He broke\noff with a start. \"Rudie! By Jove, I forgot! Did you find them? Where's\nBertha Forrester?\"\n\n\"Gone,\" said Rudolph, and struggling to explain, found his late\nadventure shrunk into the compass of a few words, far too small and bare\nto suggest the magnitude of his decision. \"They went,\" he began, \"in\na boat--\"\n\nHe was saved the trouble; for suddenly Captain Kneebone cried in a voice\nof keen satisfaction, \"Here they come! I told ye!\"--and fired his rifle.\n\nThrough a patch of firelight, down the gentle <DW72> of the field, swept\na ragged cohort of men, some bare-headed, some in their scarlet\nnightcaps, as though they had escaped from bed, and all yelling. One of\nthe foremost, who met the captain's bullet, was carried stumbling his\nown length before he sank underfoot; as the Mausers flashed from between\nthe sand-bags, another and another man fell to his knees or toppled\nsidelong, tripping his fellows into a little knot or windrow of kicking\narms and legs; but the main wave poured on, all the faster. Among and\nabove them, like wreckage in that surf, tossed the shapes of\nscaling-ladders and notched bamboos. Two naked men, swinging between\nthem a long cylinder or log, flashed through the bonfire space and on\ninto the dark below the wall.\n\n\"Pung-dongs!\" bawled the captain. \"Look out for the pung-dong!\"\n\nHis friends were too busy firing into the crowded gloom below. Rudolph,\nfumbling at side-bolt and pulling trigger, felt the end of a ladder bump\nhis forehead, saw turban and mediaeval halberd heave above him, and\nwithout time to think of firing, dashed the muzzle of his gun at the\nclimber's face. The shock was solid, the halberd rang on the platform,\nbut the man vanished like a shade.\n\n\"Very neat,\" growled Heywood, who in the same instant, with a great\nshove, managed to fling down the ladder. \"Perfectly silly attack. We'll\nhold 'em.\"\n\nWhile he spoke, however, something hurtled over their heads and thumped\nthe platform. The queer log, or cylinder, lay there with a red coal\nsputtering at one end, a burning fuse. Heywood snatched at it and\nmissed. Some one else caught up the long bulk, and springing to his\nfeet, swung it aloft. Firelight showed the bristling moustache of\nKempner, his long, thin arms poising a great bamboo case bound with\nrings of leather or metal. He threw it out with his utmost force,\nstaggered as though to follow it; then, leaping back, straightened his\ntall body with a jerk, flung out one arm in a gesture of surprise, no\nsooner rigid than drooping; and even while he seemed inflated for\nanother of his speeches, turned half-round and dove into the garden and\nthe night. By the ending of it, he had redeemed a somewhat rancid life.\n\nBefore, the angle was alive with swarming heads. As he fell, it was\nempty, and the assault finished; for below, the bamboo tube burst with a\nsound that shook the wall; liquid flame, the Greek fire of stink-pot\nchemicals, squirted in jets that revealed a crowd torn asunder, saffron\nfaces contorted in shouting, and men who leapt away with clothes afire\nand powder-horns bursting at their sides. Dim figures scampered off, up\nthe rising ground.\n\n\"That's over,\" panted Heywood. \"Thundering good lesson,--Here, count\nnoses. Rudie? Right-oh. Sturgeon, Teppich, Padre, Captain? Good! but\nlook sharp, while I go inspect.\" He whispered to Rudolph. \"Come down,\nwon't you, and help me with--you know.\"\n\nAt the foot of the ladder, they met a man in white, with a white face in\nwhat might be the dawn, or the pallor of the late-risen moon.\n\n\"Is Hackh there?\" He hailed them in a dry voice, and cleared his throat,\n\"Where is she? Where's my wife?\"\n\nIt was here, accordingly, while Heywood stooped over a tumbled object on\nthe ground, that Rudolph told her husband what Bertha Forrester had\nchosen. The words came harder than before, but at last he got rid of\nthem. His questioner stood very still. It was like telling the news of\nan absent ghost to another present.\n\n\"This town was never a place,\" said Gilly, with all his former\nsteadiness,--\"never a place to bring a woman. And--and of her age.\"\n\nAll three men listened to the conflict of gongs and crackers, and to the\nshouting, now muffled and distant behind the knoll. All three, as it\nseemed to Rudolph, had consented to ignore something vile.\n\n\"That's all I wanted to know,\" said the older man, slowly. \"I must get\nback to my post. You didn't say, but--She made no attempt to come here?\nWell, that's--that's lucky. I'll go back.\"\n\nFor some time again they stood as though listening, till Heywood\nspoke:--\n\n\"Holding your own, are you, by the water gate?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Forrester, rousing slightly. \"All quiet there. No\nmore arrows. Converts behaving splendidly. Two or three have begged\nfor guns.\"\n\n\"Give 'em this.\" Heywood skipped up the ladder, to return with a rifle.\n\"And this belt--Kempner's. Poor chap, he'll never ask you to return\nthem.--Anything else?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Gilly, taking the dead man's weapon, and moving off into\nthe darkness. \"No, except \"--He halted. \"Except if we come to a pinch,\nand need a man for some tight place, then give me first chance. Won't\nyou? I could do better, now, than--than you younger men. Oh, and Hackh;\nyour efforts to-night--Well, few men would have dared, and I feel\nimmensely grateful.\"\n\nHe disappeared among the orange trees, leaving Rudolph to think about\nsuch gratitude.\n\n\"Now, then,\" called Heywood, and stooped to the white bundle at their\nfeet. \"Don't stand looking. Can't be helped. Trust old Gilly to take it\nlike a man. Come bear a hand.\"\n\nAnd between them the two friends carried to the nunnery a tiresome\ntheorist, who had acted once, and now, himself tired and limp, would\noffend no more by speaking.\n\nWhen the dawn filled the compound with a deep blue twilight, and this in\nturn grew pale, the night-long menace of noise gradually faded also,\nlike an orgy of evil spirits dispersing before cockcrow. To ears long\ndeafened, the wide stillness had the effect of another sound, never\nheard before. Even when disturbed by the flutter of birds darting from\ntop to dense green top of the orange trees, the air seemed hushed by\nsome unholy constraint. Through the cool morning vapors, hot smoke from\nsmouldering wreckage mounted thin and straight, toward where the pale\ndisk of the moon dissolved in light. The convex field stood bare, except\nfor a few overthrown scarecrows in naked yellow or dusty blue, and for a\njagged strip of earthwork torn from the crest, over which the Black Dog\nthrust his round muzzle. In a truce of empty silence, the defenders\nslept by turns among the sand-bags.\n\nThe day came, and dragged by without incident. The sun blazed in the\ncompound, swinging overhead, and slanting down through the afternoon. At\nthe water gate, Rudolph, Heywood, and the padre, with a few forlorn\nChristians,--driven in like sheep, at the last moment,--were building\na rough screen against the arrows that had flown in darkness, and that\nnow lay scattered along the path. One of these a workman suddenly caught\nat, and with a grunt, held up before the padre.\n\nThe head was blunt. About the shaft, wound tightly with silk thread, ran\na thin roll of Chinese paper.\n\nDr. Earle nodded, took the arrow, and slitting with a pocket-knife,\nfreed and flattened out a painted scroll of complex characters. His keen\nold eyes ran down the columns. His face, always cloudy now, grew darker\nwith perplexity.\n\n\"A message,\" he declared slowly. \"I think a serious message.\" He sat\ndown on a pile of sacks, and spread the paper on his knee. \"But the\ncharacters are so elaborate--I can't make head or tail.\"\n\nHe beckoned Heywood, and together they scowled at the intricate and\nmeaningless symbols.\n\n\"All alike,\" complained the younger man. \"Maddening.\" Then his face\nlighted. \"No, see here--lower left hand.\"\n\nThe last stroke of the brush, down in the corner, formed a loose \"O. W.\"\n\n\"From Wutzler. Must mean something.\"\n\nFor all that, the painted lines remained a stubborn puzzle.\n\n\"Something, yes. But what?\" The padre pulled out a cigar, and smoking\nat top speed, spaced off each character with his thumb. \"They are all\nalike, and yet\"--He clutched his white hair with big knuckles, and\ntugged; replaced his mushroom helmet; held the paper at a new focus.\n\"Ah!\" he said doubtfully; and at last, \"Yes.\" For some time he read to\nhimself, nodding. \"A Triad cipher.\"\n\n\"Well?\" resumed Heywood, patiently.\n\nThe reader pointed with his cigar.\n\n\"Take only the left half of that word, and what have you?\"\n\n\"'Lightning,'\" read Heywood.\n\n\"The right half?\"\n\n\"'Boat.'\"\n\n\"Take,\" the padre ordered, \"this one; left half?\"\n\n\"'Lightning,'\" repeated his pupil. \"The right half--might be\n'rice-scoop,' But that's nonsense.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the padre. \"You have the secret. It's good Triad writing.\nSubtract this twisted character 'Lightning' from each, and we've made\nthe crooked straight. The writer was afraid of being caught. Here's the\nsense of his message, I take it.\" And he read off, slowly:--\n\n\"A Hakka boat on opposite shore; a green flag and a rice-scoop hoisted\nat her mast; light a fire on the water-gate steps, and she will come\nquickly, day or night.--O.W.\"\n\nHeywood took the news coldly. He shook his head, and stood thinking.\n\n\"That won't help,\" he said curtly. \"Never in the world.\"\n\nWith the aid of a convert, he unbarred the ponderous gate, and ventured\nout on the highest slab of the landing-steps. Across the river, to be\nsure, there lay--between a local junk and a stray _papico_ from the\nnorth--the high-nosed Hakka boat, her deck roofed with tawny\nbasket-work, and at her masthead a wooden rice-measure dangling below a\ngreen rag. Aft, by the great steering-paddle, perched a man, motionless,\nyet seeming to watch. Heywood turned, however, and pointed downstream to\nwhere, at the bend of the river, a little spit of mud ran out from the\nmarsh. On the spit, from among tussocks, a man in a round hat sprang up\nlike a thin black toadstool. He waved an arm, and gave a shrill cry,\nsummoning help from further inland. Other hats presently came bobbing\ntoward him, low down among the marsh. Puffs of white spurted out from\nthe mud. And as Heywood dodged back through the gate, and Nesbit's rifle\nanswered from his little fort on the pony-shed, the distant crack of the\nmuskets joined with a spattering of ooze and a chipping of stone on the\nriver-stairs.\n\n\"Covered, you see,\" said Heywood, replacing the bar. \"Last resort,\nperhaps, that way. Still, we may as well keep a bundle of firewood\nready here.\"\n\nThe shots from the marsh, though trivial and scattering, were like a\nsignal; for all about the nunnery, from a ring of hiding-places, the\nnoise of last night broke out afresh. The sun lowered through a brown,\nburnt haze, the night sped up from the ocean, covering the sky with\nsudden darkness, in which stars appeared, many and cool, above the\ntorrid earth and the insensate turmoil. So, without change but from\npause to outbreak, outbreak to pause, nights and days went by in\nthe siege.\n\nNothing happened. One morning, indeed, the fragments of another blunt\narrow came to light, broken underfoot and trampled into the dust. The\npaper scroll, in tatters, held only a few marks legible through dirt and\nheel-prints: \"Listen--work fast--many bags--watch closely.\" And still\nnothing happened to explain the warning.\n\nThat night Heywood even made a sortie, and stealing from the main gate\nwith four coolies, removed to the river certain relics that lay close\nunder the wall, and would soon become intolerable. He had returned\nsafely, with an ancient musket, a bag of bullets, a petroleum squirt,\nand a small bundle of pole-axes, and was making his tour of the\ndefenses, when he stumbled over Rudolph, who knelt on the ground under\nwhat in old days had been the chapel, and near what now was\nKempner's grave.\n\nHe was not kneeling in devotion, for he took Heywood by the arm, and\nmade him stoop.\n\n\"I was coming,\" he said, \"to find you. The first night, I saw coolies\nworking in the clay-pit. Bend, a moment over. Put now the ear close.\"\n\nHeywood laid his cheek in the dust.\n\n\"They're keeping such a racket outside,\" he muttered; and then, half to\nhimself: \"It certainly is. Rudie, it's--it's as if poor Kempner\nwere--waking up.\" He listened again. \"You're right. They are digging.\"\n\nThe two friends sat up, and eyed each other in the starlight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nBROTHER MOLES\n\nThis new danger, working below in the solid earth, had thrown Rudolph\ninto a state of sullen resignation. What was the use now, he thought\nindignantly, of all their watching and fighting? The ground, at any\nmoment, might heave, break, and spring up underfoot. He waited for his\nfriend to speak out, and put the same thought roundly into words.\nInstead, to his surprise, he heard something quite contrary.\n\n\"Now we know!\" said Heywood, in lively satisfaction. \"Now we know what\nthe beasts have up their sleeve. That's a comfort. Rather!\"\n\nHe sat thinking, a white figure in the starlight, cross-legged like a\nBuddha.\n\n\"That's why they've all been lying doggo,\" he continued. \"And then their\nbad marksmanship, with all this sniping--they don't care, you see,\nwhether they pot us or not. They'd rather make one clean sweep, and\n'blow us at the moon.' Eh? Cheer up, Rudie: so long as they're digging,\nthey're not blowing. Are they?\"\n\nWhile he spoke, the din outside the walls wavered and sank, at last\ngiving place to a shrill, tiny interlude of insect voices. In this\ndiluted silence came now and then a tinkle of glass from the dark\nhospital room where Miss Drake was groping among her vials.\nHeywood listened.\n\n\"If it weren't for that,\" he said quietly, \"I shouldn't much care.\nExcept for the women, this would really be great larks.\" Then, as a\nshadow flitted past the orange grove, he roused himself to hail: \"Ah\nPat! Go catchee four piecee coolie-man!\"\n\n\"Can do.\" The shadow passed, and after a time returned with four other\nshadows. They stood waiting, till Heywood raised his head from the dust.\n\n\"Those noises have stopped, down there,\" he said to Rudolph; and rising,\ngave his orders briefly. The coolies were to dig, strike into the\nsappers' tunnel, and report at once: \"Chop-chop.--Meantime, Rudie, let's\ntake a holiday. We can smoke in the courtyard.\"\n\nA solitary candle burned in the far corner of the inclosure, and cast\nfaint streamers of reflection along the wet flags, which, sluiced with\nwater from the well, exhaled a slight but grateful coolness. Heywood\nstooped above the quivering flame, lighted a cigar, and sinking loosely\ninto a chair, blew the smoke upward in slow content.\n\n\"Luxury!\" he yawned. \"Nothing to do, nothing to fret about, till the\ncompradore reports. Wonderful--too good to be true.\"\n\nFor a long time, lying side by side, they might have been asleep.\nThrough the dim light on the white walls dipped and swerved the drunken\nshadow of a bat, who now whirled as a flake of blackness across the\nstars, now swooped and set the humbler flame reeling. The flutter of his\nleathern wings, and the plash of water in the dark, where a coolie still\ndrenched the flags, marked the sleepy, soothing measures in a nocturne,\nbroken at strangely regular intervals by a shot, and the crack of a\nbullet somewhere above in the deserted chambers.\n\n\"Queer,\" mused Heywood, drowsily studying his watch. \"The beggar puts\none shot every five minutes through the same window.--I wonder what he's\nthinking about? Lying out there, firing at the Red-Bristled Ghosts. Odd!\nWonder what they're all\"--He put back his cigar, mumbling. \"Handful of\npoor blackguards, all upset in their minds, and sweating round. And all\nthe rest tranquil as ever, eh?--the whole country jogging on the same\nold way, or asleep and dreaming dreams, perhaps, same kind of dreams\nthey had in Marco Polo's day.\"\n\nThe end of his cigar burned red again; and again, except for that, he\nmight have been asleep. Rudolph made no answer, but lay thinking. This\nbrief moment of rest in the cool, dim courtyard--merely to lie there\nand wait--seemed precious above all other gain or knowledge. Some quiet\ninfluence, a subtle and profound conviction, slowly was at work in him.\nIt was patience, wonder, steady confidence,--all three, and more. He had\nfelt it but this once, obscurely; might die without knowing it in\nclearer fashion; and yet could never lose it, or forget, or come to any\nlater harm. With it the stars, above the dim vagaries of the bat, were\nbrightly interwoven. For the present he had only to lie ready, and wait,\na single comrade in a happy army.\n\nThrough a dark little door came Miss Drake, all in white, and moving\nquietly, like a symbolic figure of evening, or the genius of the place.\nHer hair shone duskily as she bent beside the candle, and with steady\nfingers tilted a vial, from which amber drops fell slowly into a glass.\nWith dark eyes watching closely, she had the air of a young, beneficent\nMedea, intent on some white magic.\n\n\"Aren't you coming,\" called Heywood, \"to sit with us awhile?\"\n\n\"Can't, thanks,\" she replied, without looking up. \"I'm too busy.\"\n\n\"That's no excuse. Rest a little.\"\n\nShe moved away, carrying her medicines, but paused in the door, smiled\nback at him as from a crypt, and said:--\n\n\"Have _you_ been hurt?\"\n\n\"Only my feelings.\"\n\n\"I've no time,\" she laughed, \"for lazy able-bodied persons.\" And she was\ngone in the darkness, to sit by her wounded men.\n\nWith her went the interval of peace; for past the well-curb came another\nfigure, scuffing slowly toward the light. The compradore, his robes lost\nin their background, appeared as an oily face and a hand beckoning with\ndownward sweep. The two friends rose, and followed him down the\ncourtyard. In passing out, they discovered the padre's wife lying\nexhausted in a low chair, of which she filled half the length and all\nthe width. Heywood paused beside her with some friendly question, to\nwhich Rudolph caught the answer.\n\n\"Oh, quite composed.\" Her voice sounded fretful, her fan stirred weakly.\n\"Yes, wonderfully composed. I feel quite ready to suffer for the faith.\"\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Earle,\" said the young man, gently, \"there ought to be no\nneed. Nobody shall suffer, if we can prevent. I think we can.\"\n\nUnder the orange trees, he laid an unsteady hand on Rudolph's arm, and\nhalting, shook with quiet merriment.\n\n\"Poor dear lady!\" he whispered, and went forward chuckling.\n\nLoose earth underfoot warned them not to stumble over the new-raised\nmound beside the pit, which yawned slightly blacker than the night.\nKempner's grave had not been quieter. The compradore stood whispering:\nthey had found the tunnel empty, because, he thought, the sappers were\ngone out to eat their chow.\n\n\"We'll see, anyway,\" said Heywood, stripping off his coat. He climbed\nover the mound, grasped the edges, and promptly disappeared. In the long\nmoment which followed, the earth might have closed on him. Once, as\nRudolph bent listening over the shaft, there seemed to come a faint\nmomentary gleam; but no sound, and no further sign, until the head and\nshoulders burrowed up again.\n\n\"Big enough hole down there,\" he reported, swinging clear, and sitting\nwith his feet in the shaft. \"Regular cave. Three sacks of powder stowed\nalready, so we're none too soon.--One sack was leaky. I struck a match,\nand nearly blew myself to Casabianca.\" He paused, as if reflecting. \"It\ngives us a plan, though. Rudie: are you game for something rather\nfoolhardy? Be frank, now; for if you wouldn't really enjoy it, I'll give\nold Gilly Forrester his chance.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Rudolph, stung as by some perfidy. \"You make me--ashamed!\nThis is all ours, this part, so!\"\n\n\"Can do,\" laughed the other. \"Get off your jacket. Give me half a\nmoment start, so that you won't jump on my head.\" And he went wriggling\ndown into the pit.\n\nAn unwholesome smell of wet earth, a damp, subterranean coolness,\nenveloped Rudolph as he slid down a flue of greasy clay, and stooping,\ncrawled into the horizontal bore of the tunnel. Large enough, perhaps,\nfor two or three men to pass on all fours, it ran level, roughly cut,\nthrough earth wet with seepage from the river, but packed into a smooth\nfloor by many hands and bare knees. It widened suddenly before him. In\nthe small chamber of the mine, choked with the smell of stale betel, he\nbumped Heywood's elbow.\n\n\"Some Fragrant Ones have been working here, I should say.\" The speaker\npatted the ground with quick palms, groping. \"Phew! They've worked like\nsteam. This explains old Wutz, and his broken arrow. I say, Rudie, feel\nabout. I saw a coil of fuse lying somewhere.--At least, I thought it\nwas. Ah, never mind: have-got!\" He pulled something along the floor.\n\"How's the old forearm I gave you? I forgot that. Equal to hauling a\nsack out? Good! Catch hold, here.\"\n\nSweeping his hand in the darkness, he captured Rudolph's, and guided it\nto where a powder-bag lay.\n\n\"Now, then, carry on,\" he commanded; and crawling into the tunnel,\nflung back fragments of explanation as he tugged at his own load. \"Carry\nthese out--far as we dare--touch 'em off, you see, and block the\npassage. Far out as possible, though. We can use this hole afterward,\nfor listening in, if they try--\"\n\nHe cut the sentence short. Their tunnel had begun to <DW72> gently\ndownward, with niches gouged here and there for the passing of\nburden-bearers. Rudolph, toiling after, suddenly found his head\nentangled between his leader's boots.\n\n\"Quiet,\" he heard him whisper. \"Somebody coming.\"\n\nAn instant later, the boots withdrew quickly. An odd little squeak of\nsurprise followed, a strange gurgling, and a succession of rapid shocks,\nas though some one were pummeling the earthen walls.\n\n\"Got the beggar,\" panted Heywood. \"Only one of 'em. Roll clear, Rudie,\nand let us pass. Collar his legs, if you can, and shove.\"\n\nSqueezing past Rudolph in his niche, there struggled a convulsive bulk,\nlike some monstrous worm, too large for the bore, yet writhing. Bare\nfeet kicked him in violent rebellion, and a muscular knee jarred\nsquarely under his chin. He caught a pair of naked legs, and hugged\nthem dearly.\n\n\"Not too hard,\" called Heywood, with a breathless laugh. \"Poor\ndevil--must think he ran foul of a genie.\"\n\nIndeed, their prisoner had already given up the conflict, and lay under\nthem with limbs dissolved and quaking.\n\n\"Pass him along,\" chuckled his captor. \"Make him go ahead of us.\"\n\nProdded into action, the man stirred limply, and crawled past them\ntoward the mine, while Heywood, at his heels, growled orders in the\nvernacular with a voice of dismal ferocity. In this order they gained\nthe shaft, and wriggled up like ferrets into the night air. Rudolph,\nstanding as in a well, heard a volley of questions and a few timid\nanswers, before the returning legs of his comrade warned him to dodge\nback into the tunnel.\n\nAgain the two men crept forward on their expedition; and this time the\nleader talked without lowering his voice.\n\n\"That chap,\" he declared, \"was fairly chattering with fright. Coolie, it\nseems, who came back to find his betel-box. The rest are all outside\neating their rice. We have a clear track.\"\n\nThey stumbled on their powder-sacks, caught hold, and dragged them, at\nfirst easily down the incline, then over a short level, then arduously\nup a rising grade, till the work grew heavy and hot, and breath came\nhard in the stifled burrow.\n\n\"Far enough,\" said Heywood, puffing. \"Pile yours here.\"\n\nRudolph, however, was not only drenched with sweat, but fired by a new\nspirit, a spirit of daring. He would try, down here in the bowels of the\nearth, to emulate his friend.\n\n\"But let us reconnoitre,\" he objected. \"It will bring us to the clay-pit\nwhere I saw them digging. Let us go out to the end, and look.\"\n\n\"Well said, old mole!\" Heywood snapped his fingers with delight. \"I\nnever thought of that.\" By his tone, he was proud of the amendment.\n\"Come on, by all means. I say, I didn't really--I didn't _want_ poor old\nGilly down here, you know.\"\n\nThey crawled on, with more speed but no less caution, up the strait\nlittle gallery, which now rose between smooth, soft walls of clay.\nSuddenly, as the incline once more became a level, they saw a glimmering\nsquare of dusky red, like the fluttering of a weak flame through scarlet\ncloth. This, while they shuffled toward it, grew higher and broader,\nuntil they lay prone in the very door of the hill,--a large, square-cut\nportal, deeply overhung by the edge of the clay-pit, and flanked with\nwhat seemed a bulkhead of sand-bags piled in orderly tiers. Between\nshadowy mounds of loose earth flickered the light of a fire, small and\ndistant, round which wavered the inky silhouettes of men, and beyond\nwhich dimly shone a yellow face or two, a yellow fist clutched full of\nboiled rice like a snowball. Beyond these, in turn, gleamed other little\nfires, where other coolies were squatting at their supper.\n\n\"Rudie, look!\" Heywood's voice trembled with joyful excitement. \"Look,\nthese bags; not sand-bags at all! It's powder, old chap, powder! Their\nwhole supply. Wait a bit--oh, by Jove, wait a bit!\"\n\nHe scurried back into the hill like a great rat, returned as quickly and\nswiftly, and with eager hands began to uncoil something on the clay\nthreshold.\n\n\"Do you know enough to time a fuse?\" he whispered. \"Neither do I.\nPowder's bad, anyhow. We must guess at it. Here, quick, lend me a\nknife.\" He slashed open one of the lower sacks in the bulkhead by the\ndoor, stuffed in some kind of twisted cord, and, edging away, sat for an\ninstant with his knife-blade gleaming in the ruddy twilight. \"How long,\nRudie, how long?\" He smothered a groan. \"Too long, or too short, spoils\neverything. Oh, well--here goes.\"\n\nThe blade moved.\n\n\"Now lie across,\" he ordered, \"and shield the tandstickor.\" With a\nsudden fuff, the match blazed up to show his gray eyes bright and\ndancing, his face glossy with sweat; below, on the golden clay, the\ntwisted, lumpy tail of the fuse, like the end of a dusty vine. Darkness\nfollowed, quick and blinding. A rosy, fitful coal sputtered, darting out\nshort capillary lines and needles of fire.\n\n\"Cut sticks--go like the devil! If it blows up, and caves the earth on\nus--\" Heywood ran on hands and knees, as if that were his natural way of\ngoing. Rudolph scrambled after, now urged by an ecstasy of apprehension,\nnow clogged as by the weight of all the hill above them. If it should\nfall now, he thought, or now; and thus measuring as he crawled, found\nthe tunnel endless.\n\nWhen at last, however, they gained the bottom of the shaft, and were\nhoisted out among their coolies on the shelving mound, the evening\nstillness lay above and about them, undisturbed. The fuse could never\nhave lasted all these minutes. Their whole enterprise was but labor\nlost. They listened, breathing short. No sound came.\n\n\"Gone out,\" said Heywood, gloomily. \"Or else they saw it.\"\n\nHe climbed the bamboo scaffold, and stood looking over the wall. Rudolph\nperched beside him,--by the same anxious, futile instinct of curiosity,\nfor they could see nothing but the night and the burning stars.\n\n\"Gone out. Underground again, Rudie, and try our first plan.\" Heywood\nturned to leap down. \"The Sword-Pen looks to set off his mine\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\nHe clutched the wall in time to save himself, as the bamboo frame leapt\nunderfoot. Outside, the crest of the <DW72> ran black against a single\nburst of flame. The detonation came like the blow of a mallet on\nthe ribs.\n\n\"Let him look! Let him look!\" Heywood jumped to the ground, and in a\npelting shower of clods, exulted:--\n\n\n\"He looked again, and saw it was\nThe middle of next week!\"\n\n\n\"Come on, brother mole. Spread the news!\"\n\nHe ran off, laughing, in the wide hush of astonishment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nTHE HAKKA BOAT\n\n\"Pretty fair,\" Captain Kneebone said. \"But that ain't the end.\"\n\nThis grudging praise--in which, moreover, Heywood tamely acquiesced--was\nhis only comment. On Rudolph it had singular effects: at first filling\nhim with resentment, and almost making him suspect the little captain of\njealousy; then amusing him, as chance words of no weight; but in the\nunreal days that followed, recurring to convince him with all the force\nof prompt and subtle fore-knowledge. It helped him to learn the cold,\nsalutary lesson, that one exploit does not make a victory.\n\nThe springing of their countermine, he found, was no deliverance. It had\ntwo plain results, and no more: the crest of the high field, without,\nhad changed its contour next morning as though a monster had bitten it;\nand when the day had burnt itself out in sullen darkness, there burst on\nall sides an attack of prolonged and furious exasperation. The fusillade\nnow came not only from the landward sides, but from a long flotilla of\nboats in the river; and although these vanished at dawn, the fire never\nslackened, either from above the field, or from a distant wall, newly\nspotted with loopholes, beyond the ashes of the go-down. On the night\nfollowing, the boats crept closer, and suddenly both gates resounded\nwith the blows of battering-rams. These and later assaults were beaten\noff. By daylight, the nunnery walls were pitted as with small-pox; yet\nthe little company remained untouched, except for Teppich, whose shaven\nhead was trimmed still closer and redder by a bullet, and for Gilbert\nForrester, who showed--with the grave smile of a man when fates are\nplayful--two shots through his loose jacket.\n\nHe was the only man to smile; for the others, parched by days and\nsweltered by nights of battle, questioned each other with hollow eyes\nand sleepy voices. One at a time, in patches of hot shade, they lay\ntumbled for a moment of oblivion, their backs studded thickly with\nobstinate flies like the driven heads of nails. As thickly, in the dust,\nempty Mauser cartridges lay glistening.\n\n\"And I bought food,\" mourned the captain, chafing the untidy stubble on\nhis cheeks, and staring gloomily down at the worthless brass. \"I bought\nchow, when all Saigong was full o' cartridges!\"\n\nThe sight of the spent ammunition at their feet gave them more trouble\nthan the swarming flies, or the heat, or the noises tearing and\nsplitting the heat. Even Heywood went about with a hang-dog air,\nspeaking few words, and those more and more surly. Once he laughed, when\nat broad noonday a line of queer heads popped up from the earthwork on\nthe knoll, and stuck there, tilted at odd angles, as though peering\nquizzically. Both his laugh, however, and his one stare of scrutiny were\nfilled with a savage contempt,--contempt not only for the stratagem, but\nfor himself, the situation, all things.\n\n\"Dummies--lay figures, to draw our fire. What a childish trick! Maskee!\"\nhe added, wearily \"we couldn't waste a shot at 'em now even if they\nwere real.\"\n\nHis grimy hearers nodded mechanically. They knew, without being told,\nthat they should fire no more until at close quarters in some\nfinal rush.\n\n\"Only a few more rounds apiece,\" he continued. \"Our friends outside must\nhave run nearly as short, according to the coolie we took prisoner in\nthe tunnel. But they'll get more supplies, he says, in a day or two.\nWhat's worse, his Generalissimo Fang expects big reinforcement, any day,\nfrom up country. He told me that a moment ago.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's lying,\" said Captain Kneebone, drowsily.\n\n\"Wish he were,\" snapped Heywood. \"No such luck. Too stupid.\"\n\n\"That case,\" grumbled the captain, \"we'd better signal your Hakka boat,\nand clear out.\"\n\nAgain their hollow eyes questioned each other in discouragement. It was\nplain that he had spoken their general thought; but they were all too\nhot and sleepy to debate even a point of safety. Thus, in stupor or\ndoubt, they watched another afternoon burn low by invisible degrees,\nlike a great fire dying. Another breathless evening settled over all--at\nfirst with a dusty, copper light, widespread, as though sky and land\nwere seen through smoked glass; another dusk, of deep, sad blue; and\nwhen this had given place to night, another mysterious lull.\n\nMidnight drew on, and no further change had come. Prowlers, made bold by\nthe long silence in the nunnery, came and went under the very walls of\nthe compound. In the court, beside a candle, Ah Pat the compradore sat\nwith a bundle of halberds and a whetstone, sharpening edge after edge,\nplacidly, against the time when there should be no more cartridges.\nHeywood and Rudolph stood near the water gate, and argued with Gilbert\nForrester, who would not quit his post for either of them.\n\n\"But I'm not sleepy,\" he repeated, with perverse, irritating serenity.\n\"I'm not, I assure you. And that river full of their boats?--Go away.\"\n\nWhile they reasoned and wrangled, something scraped the edge of the\nwall. They could barely detect a small, stealthy movement above them, as\nif a man, climbing, had lifted his head over the top. Suddenly, beside\nit, flared a surprising torch, rags burning greasily at the end of a\nlong bamboo. The smoky, dripping flame showed no man there, but only\nanother long bamboo, impaling what might be another ball of rags. The\ntwo poles swayed, inclined toward each other; for one incredible instant\nthe ball, beside its glowing fellow, shone pale and took on human\nfeatures. Black shadows filled the eye-sockets, and gave to the face an\nuncertain, cavernous look, as though it saw and pondered.\n\nHow long the apparition stayed, the three men could not tell; for even\nafter it vanished, and the torch fell hissing in the river, they stood\nbelow the wall, dumb and sick, knowing only that they had seen the head\nof Wutzler.\n\nHeywood was the first to make a sound--a broken, hypnotic sound, without\nemphasis or inflection, as though his lips were frozen, or the words\ntorn from him by ventriloquy.\n\n\"We must get the women--out of here.\"\n\nAfterward, when he was no longer with them, his two friends recalled\nthat he never spoke again that night, but came and went in a kind of\nsilent rage, ordering coolies by dumb-show, and carrying armful after\narmful of supplies to the water gate. He would neither pause nor answer.\n\nThe word passed, or a listless, tacit understanding, that every one must\nhold himself ready to go aboard so soon after daylight as the hostile\nboats should leave the river. \"If,\" said Gilly to Rudolph, while they\nstood thinking under the stars, \"if his boat is still there, now that\nhe--after what we saw.\"\n\nAt dawn they could see the ragged flotilla of sampans stealing up-river\non the early flood; but of the masts that huddled in vapors by the\nfarther bank, they had no certainty until sunrise, when the green rag\nand the rice-measure appeared still dangling above the Hakka boat.\n\nEven then it was not certain--as Captain Kneebone sourly pointed\nout--that her sailors would keep their agreement. And when he had piled,\non the river-steps, the dry wood for their signal fire, a new difficulty\nrose. One of the wounded converts was up, and hobbling with a stick; but\nthe other would never be ferried down any stream known to man. He lay\ndying, and the padre could not leave him.\n\nAll the others waited, ready and anxious; but no one grumbled because\ndeath, never punctual, now kept them waiting. The flutter of birds,\namong the orange trees, gradually ceased; the sun came slanting over\nthe eastern wall; the gray floor of the compound turned white and\nblurred through the dancing heat. A torrid westerly breeze came\nfitfully, rose, died away, rose again, and made Captain Kneebone curse.\n\n\"A fair wind lost,\" he muttered. \"Next we'll lose the ebb, too, be\n'anged.\"\n\nNoon passed, and mid-afternoon, before the padre came out from the\ncourtyard, covering his white head with his ungainly helmet.\n\n\"We may go now,\" he said gravely, \"in a few minutes.\"\n\nNo more were needed, for the loose clods in the old shaft of their\ncounter-mine were quickly handled, and the necessary words soon uttered.\nCaptain Kneebone had slipped out through the water gate, beforehand, and\nlighted the fire on the steps. But not one of the burial party turned\nhis head, to watch the success or failure of their signal, so long as\nthe padre's resonant bass continued.\n\nWhen it ceased, however, they returned quickly through the little grove.\nThe captain opened the great gate, and looked out eagerly, craning to\nsee through the smoke that poured into his face.\n\n\"The wasters!\" he cried bitterly. \"She's gone.\"\n\nThe Hakka boat had, indeed, vanished from her moorings. On the bronze\ncurrent, nothing moved but three fishing-boats drifting down, with the\nsmoke, toward the marsh and the bend of the river, and a small junk that\ntoiled up against wind and tide, a cluster of naked sailors tugging and\nshoving at her heavy sweep, which chafed its rigging of dry rope, and\ngave out a high, complaining note like the cry of a sea-gull.\n\n\"She's gone,\" repeated Captain Kneebone. \"No boat for us.\"\n\nBut the compradore, dragging his bundle of sharp halberds, poked an\ninquisitive head out past the captain's, and peered on all sides through\nthe smoke, with comical thoroughness. He dodged back, grinning and\nducking amiably.\n\n\"Moh bettah look-see,\" he chuckled; \"dat coolie come-back, he too muchee\nwaitee, b'long one piecee foolo-man.\"\n\nHe was wrong. Whoever handled the Hakka boat was no fool, but by working\nupstream on the opposite shore, crossing above, and dropping down with\nthe ebb, had craftily brought her along the shallow, so close beneath\nthe river-wall, that not till now did even the little captain spy her.\nThe high prow, the mast, now bare, and her round midships roof, bright\ngolden-thatched with leaves of the edible bamboo, came moving quiet as\nsome enchanted boat in a calm. The fugitives by the gate still thought\nthemselves abandoned, when her beak, six feet in air, stole past them,\nand her lean boatmen, prodding the river-bed with their poles, stopped\nher as easily as a gondola. The yellow steersman grinned, straining at\nthe pivot of his gigantic paddle.\n\n\"Good boy, lowdah!\" called Kneebone. \"Remember _you_ in my will, too!\"\nAnd the grinning lowdah nodded, as though he understood.\n\nThey had now only to pitch their supplies through the smoke, down on the\nloose boards of her deck. Then--Rudolph and the captain kicking the\nbonfire off the stairs--the whole company hurried down and safely over\nher gunwale: first the two women, then the few huddling converts, the\nwhite men next, the compradore still hugging his pole-axes, and last of\nall, Heywood, still in strange apathy, with haggard face and downcast\neyes. He stumbled aboard as though drunk, his rifle askew under one arm,\nand in the crook of the other, Flounce, the fox-terrier, dangling,\nnervous and wide awake.\n\nHe looked to neither right nor left, met nobody's eye. The rest of the\ncompany crowded into the house amidships, and flung themselves down\nwearily in the grateful dusk, where vivid paintings and mysteries of\nrude carving writhed on the fir bulkheads. But Heywood, with his dog and\nthe captain and Rudolph, sat in the hot sun, staring down at the\nramshackle deck, through the gaps in which rose all the stinks of the\nsweating hold.\n\nThe boatmen climbed the high slant of the bow, planted their stout\nbamboos against their shoulders, and came slowly down, head first, like\nstraining acrobats. As slowly, the boat began to glide past the stairs.\n\nThus far, though the fire lay scattered in the mud, the smoke drifted\nstill before them and obscured their silent, headlong transaction. Now,\nthinning as they dropped below the corner of the wall, it left them\nnaked to their enemies on the knoll. At the same instant, from the marsh\nahead, the sentinel in the round hat sprang up again, like an\ninstantaneous mushroom. He shouted, and waved to his fellows inland.\n\nThey had no time, however, to leave the high ground; for the whole\nchance of the adventure took a sudden and amazing turn.\n\nHeywood sprang out of his stupor, and stood pointing.\n\n\"Look there!\" he snarled. \"Those--oh!\"\n\nHe ended with a groan. The face of his friend, by torchlight above the\nwall, had struck him dumb. Now that he spoke, his companions saw,\nexposed in the field to the view of the nunnery, a white body lying on a\nframework as on a bier. Near the foot stood a rough sort of windlass.\nAbove, on the crest of the field, where a band of men had begun to\nscramble at the sentinel's halloo, there sat on a white pony the\nbright-robed figure of the tall fanatic, Fang the Sword-Pen.\n\n\"He did it!\" Heywood's hands opened and shut rapidly, like things out of\ncontrol. \"Oh, Wutz, how did they--Saint Somebody--the martyrdom--\nPoussin's picture in the Vatican.--I can't stand this, you chaps!\"\n\nHe snatched blindly at his gun, caught instead one of the compradore's\nhalberds, and without pause or warning, jumped out into the shallow\nwater. He ran splashing toward the bank, turned, and seemed to waver,\nstaring with wild eyes at the strange Tudor weapon in his hand. Then\nshaking it savagely,--\n\n\"This will do!\" he cried. \"Good-by, everybody. Good-by!\"\n\nHe wheeled again, staggered to his feet on dry ground, and ran swiftly\nalong the eastern wall, up the rising field, straight toward his mark.\n\nOf the men on the knoll, a few fired and missed, the others, neutrals to\ntheir will, stood fixed in wonder. Four or five, as the runner neared,\nsprang out to intercept, but flew apart like ninepins. The watchers in\nthe boat saw the halberd flash high in the late afternoon sun, the\nfrightened pony swerve, and his rider go down with the one sweep of that\nHomeric blow.\n\nThe last they saw of Heywood, he went leaping from sight over the\ncrest, that swarmed with figures racing and stumbling after.\n\nThe unheeded sentinel in the marsh fled, losing his great hat, as the\nboat drifted round the point into midstream.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nTHE DRAGON'S SHADOW\n\nThe lowdah would have set his dirty sails without delay, for the fair\nwind was already drooping; but at the first motion he found himself\ndeposed, and a usurper in command, at the big steering-paddle. Captain\nKneebone, his cheeks white and suddenly old beneath the untidy stubble\nof his beard, had taken charge. In momentary danger of being cut off\ndownstream, or overtaken from above, he kept the boat waiting along the\noozy shore. Puckering his eyes, he watched now the land, and now the\nriver, silent, furtive, and keenly perplexed, his head on a swivel, as\nthough he steered by some nightmare chart, or expected some instant and\ntransforming sight.\n\nNot until the sun touched the western hills, and long shadows from the\nbank stole out and turned the stream from bright copper to vague\niron-gray, did he give over his watch. He left the tiller, with a\nhopeless fling of the arm.\n\n\"Do as ye please,\" he growled, and cast himself down on deck by the\nthatched house. \"Go on.--I'll never see _him_ again.--The heat, and\nall--By the head, he was--Go on. That's all. Finish.\"\n\nHe sat looking straight before him, with dull eyes that never moved;\nnor did he stir at the dry rustle and scrape of the matting sail, slowly\nhoisted above him. The quaggy banks, now darkening, slid more rapidly\nastern; while the steersman and his mates in the high bow invoked the\nwind with alternate chant, plaintive, mysterious, and half musical:--\n\n\n\"Ay-ly-chy-ly\nAh-ha-aah!\"\n\n\nTo the listeners, huddled in silence, the familiar cry became a long,\nmonotonous accompaniment to sad thoughts. Through the rhythm, presently,\nbroke a sound of small-arms,--a few shots, quick but softened by\ndistance, from far inland. The stillness of evening followed.\n\nThe captain stirred, listened, dropped his head, and sat like stone. To\nRudolph, near him, the brief disturbance called up another evening--his\nfirst on this same river, when from the grassy brink, above, he had\nfirst heard of his friend. Now, at the same place, and by the same\nlight, they had heard the last. It was intolerable: he turned his back\non the captain. Inside, in the gloom of the painted cabin, the padre's\nwife began suddenly to cry. After a time, the deep voice of her husband,\nspeaking very low, and to her alone, became dimly audible:--\n\n\"'All this is come upon us; yet have we not--Our heart is not turned\nback, neither have our steps declined--Though thou hast sore broken us\nin the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.'\"\n\nThe little captain groaned, and rolled aside from the doorway.\n\n\"All very fine,\" he muttered, his head wrapped in his arms. \"But that's\nno good to me. I can't stand it.\"\n\nWhether she heard him, or by chance, Miss Drake came quietly from\nwithin, and found a place between him and the gunwale. He did not rouse;\nshe neither glanced nor spoke, but leaned against the ribs of\nsmooth-worn fir, as though calmly waiting.\n\nWhen at last he looked up, to see her face and posture, he gave an angry\nstart.\n\n\"And I thought,\" he blurted, \"be 'anged if sometimes I didn't think you\nliked him!\"\n\nHer dark eyes met the captain's with a great and steadfast clearness.\n\n\"No,\" she whispered; \"it was more than that.\"\n\nThe captain sat bolt upright, but no longer in condemnation. For a long\ntime he watched her, marveling; and when finally he spoke, his sharp,\ndomineering voice was lowered, almost gentle.\n\n\"Always talked too much,\" he said. \"Don't mind me, my dear. I never\nmeant--Don't ye mind a rough old beggar, that don't know that hasn't one\nthing more between him and the grave. Not a thing--but money. And that,\nnow--I wish't was at the bottom o' this bloomin' river!\"\n\nThey said no more, but rested side by side, like old friends joined\ncloser by new grief. Flounce, the terrier, snuffing disconsolately about\nthe deck, and scratching the boards in her zeal to explore the shallow\nhold, at last grew weary, and came to snuggle down between the two\nsilent companions. Not till then did the girl turn aside her face, as\nthough studying the shore, which now melted in a soft, half-liquid band\nas black as coal-tar, above the luminous indigo of the river.\n\nSuddenly Rudolph got upon his feet, and craning outboard from gunwale\nand thatched eaves, looked steadily forward into the dusk. A chatter of\nangry voices came stealing up, in the pauses of the wind. He watched and\nlistened, then quickly drew in his head.\n\n\"Sit quiet,\" he said. \"A boat full of men. I do not like their looks.\"\n\nTwo or three of the voices hailed together, raucously. The steersman,\nleaning on the loom of his paddle, made neither stir nor answer. They\nhailed again, this time close aboard, and as it seemed, in rage.\nGlancing contemptuously to starboard, the lowdah made some negligent\nreply, about a cargo of human hair. His indifference appeared so real,\nthat for a moment Rudolph suspected him: perhaps he had been bought\nover, and this meeting arranged. The thought, however, was unjust. The\nvoices began to drop astern, and to come in louder confusion with\nthe breeze.\n\nBut at this point Flounce, the terrier, spoiled all by whipping up\nbeside the lowdah, and furiously barking. Hers was no pariah's yelp: she\nbarked with spirit, in the King's English.\n\nFor answer, there came a shout, a sharp report, and a bullet that ripped\nthrough the matting sail. The steersman ducked, but clung bravely to his\npaddle. Men tumbled out from the cabin, rifles in hand, to join Rudolph\nand the captain.\n\nAstern, dangerously near, they saw the hostile craft, small, but listed\nheavily with crowding ruffians, packed so close that their great wicker\nhats hung along the gunwale to save room, and shone dim in the obscurity\nlike golden shields of vikings. A squat, burly fellow, shouting, jammed\nthe yulow hard to bring her about.\n\n\"Save your fire,\" called Captain Kneebone. \"No shots to waste. Sit\ntight.\"\n\nAs he spoke, however, an active form bounced up beside the squat man at\nthe sweep,--a plump, muscular little barefoot woman in blue. She tore\nthe fellow's hands away, and took command, keeping the boat's nose\npointed up-river, and squalling ferocious orders to all on board.\n\n\"The Pretty Lily!\" cried Rudolph. This small, nimble, capable creature\ncould be no one but Mrs. Wu, their friend and gossip of that morning,\nlong ago....\n\nThe squat man gave an angry shout, and turned on her to wrest away the\nhandle. He failed, at once and for all. With great violence, yet with a\nneat economy of motion, the Pretty Lily took one hand from her tiller,\nlong enough to topple him overboard with a sounding splash.\n\nHer passengers, at so prompt and visual a joke, burst into shrill,\ncackling laughter. Yet more shrill, before their mood could alter, the\nPretty Lily scourged them with the tongue of a humorous woman. She held\nher course, moreover; the two boats drifted so quickly apart that when\nshe turned, to fling a comic farewell after the white men, they could no\nmore than descry her face, alert and comely, and the whiteness of her\nteeth. Her laughing cry still rang, the overthrown leader still\nfloundered in the water, when the picture blurred and vanished. Down the\nwind came her words, high, voluble, quelling all further mutiny aboard\nthat craft of hers.\n\n\"We owe this to you.\" The tall padre eyed Rudolph with sudden interest,\nand laid his big hand on the young man's shoulder. \"Did you catch what\nshe said? You made a good friend there.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Rudolph, and shook his head, sadly. \"We owe that to--some\none else.\"\n\nLater, while they drifted down to meet the sea and the night, he told\nthe story, to which all listened with profound attention, wondering at\nthe turns of fortune, and at this last service, rendered by a friend\nthey should see no more.\n\nThey murmured awhile, by twos and threes huddled in corners; then lay\nsilent, exhausted in body and spirit. The river melted with the shore\ninto a common blackness, faintly hovered over by the hot, brown, sullen\nevening. Unchallenged, the Hakka boat flitted past the lights of a\nwar-junk, so close that the curved lantern-ribs flickered thin and sharp\nagainst a smoky gleam, and tawny faces wavered, thick of lip and stolid\nof eye, round the supper fire. A greasy, bitter smell of cooking floated\nafter. Then no change or break in the darkness, except a dim lantern or\ntwo creeping low in a sampan, with a fragment of talk from unseen\npassers; until, as the stars multiplied overhead, the night of the land\nrolled heavily astern and away from another, wider night, the stink of\nthe marshes failed, and by a blind sense of greater buoyancy and\nsea-room, the voyagers knew that they had gained the roadstead. Ahead,\nfar off and lustrous, a new field of stars hung scarce higher than\ntheir gunwale, above the rim of the world.\n\nThe lowdah showed no light; and presently none was needed, for--as the\nshallows gave place to deeps--the ocean boiled with the hoary,\ngreen-gold magic of phosphorus, that heaved alongside in soft explosions\nof witch-fire, and sent uncertain smoky tremors playing through the\ndarkness on deck. Rudolph, watching this tropic miracle, could make out\nthe white figure of the captain, asleep near by, under the faint\nsemicircle of the deck-house; and across from him, Miss Drake, still\nsitting upright, as though waiting, with Flounce at her side. Landward,\nagainst the last sage-green vapor of daylight, ran the dim range of the\nhills, in long undulations broken by sharper crests, like the finny back\nof leviathan basking.\n\nOver there, thought Rudolph, beyond that black shape as beyond its\nguarding dragon, lay the whole mysterious and peaceful empire, with\nuncounted lives going on, ending, beginning, as though he, and his sore\nloss, and his heart vacant of all but grief, belonged to some\nunheard-of, alien process, to Nature's most unworthy trifling. This\nboatload of men and women--so huge a part of his own experience--was\nlike the tiniest barnacle chafed from the side of that dark,\nserene monster.\n\nRudolph stared long at the hills, and as they faded, hung his head.\nFrom that dragon he had learned much; yet now all learning was but loss.\n\nOf a sudden the girl spoke, in a clear yet guarded voice, too low to\nreach the sleepers.\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" she said. \"Come tell me. It will be good for\nboth of us.\"\n\nRudolph crossed silently, and stood leaning on the gunwale beside her.\n\n\"I thought only,\" he answered, \"how much the hills looked so--as a\ndragon.\"\n\n\"How strange.\" The trembling phosphorus half-revealed her face, pale and\nstill. \"I was thinking of that, in a way. It reminded me of what he\nsaid, once--when we were walking together.\"\n\nTo their great relief, they found themselves talking of Heywood, sadly,\nbut freely, and as it were in a sudden calm. Their friendship seemed,\nfor the moment, a thing as long established as the dragon hills. Years\nafterward, Rudolph recalled her words, plainer than the fiery wonder\nthat spread and burst round their little vessel, or the long play of\nheat-lightning which now, from time to time, wavered instantly along the\neastern sea-line.\n\n\"You are right,\" she declared once. \"To go on with life, even when we\nare alone--You will go on, I know. Bravely.\" And again she said: \"Yes,\nsuch men as he are--a sort of Happy Warrior.\" And later, in her slow and\nlevel voice: \"You learned something, you say. Isn't that--what I\ncall--being invulnerable? When a man's greater than anything that\nhappens to him--\"\n\nSo they talked, their speech bare and simple, but the pauses and longer\nsilences filled with deep understanding, solemnized by the time and the\nplace, as though their two lonely spirits caught wisdom from the night,\nscope from the silent ocean, light from the flickering East.\n\nThe flashes, meanwhile, came faster and prolonged their glory, running\nbehind a thin, dead screen of scalloped clouds, piercing the tropic sky\nwith summer blue, and ripping out the lost horizon like a long black\nfibre from pulp. The two friends watched in silence, when Rudolph rose,\nand moved cautiously aft.\n\n\"Good-night,\" he whispered. \"You must sleep now.\"\n\nThat was not, however, the reason. So long as the boiling witch-fire\nturned their wake to golden vapor, he could not be sure; but whenever\nthe heat-lightning ran, and through the sere, phantasmal sail, the\nlookout in the bow flashed like a sharp silhouette through wire\ngauze,--then it seemed to Rudolph that another small black shape leapt\nout astern, and vanished. He stood by the lowdah, watching anxiously.\n\nTime and again the ocean flickered into view, like the floor of a\nmeasureless cavern; and still he could not tell. But at last the lowdah\nalso turned his head, and murmured. Their boat creaked monotonously,\ndrifting to leeward in a riot of golden mist; yet now another creaking\ndisturbed the night, in a different cadence. Another boat followed them,\nrowing fast and gaining. In a brighter flash, her black sail fluttered,\nunmistakable.\n\nRudolph reached for his gun, but waited silently. He would not call out.\nSome chance fisherman, it might be, or any small craft holding the same\ncourse along the coast. Still, he did not like the hurry of the sweeps,\nwhich presently groaned louder and threw up nebulous fire. The\nstranger's bow became an arrowhead of running gold.\n\nAnd here was Flounce, ready to misbehave once more. Before he could\ncatch her, the small white body of the terrier whipped by him, and past\nthe steersman. This time, however, as though cowed, she began to\nwhimper, and then maintained a long, trembling whine.\n\nBeside Rudolph, the compradore's head bobbed up.\n\n\"Allo same she mastah come.\" And in his native tongue, Ah Pat grumbled\nsomething about ghosts.\n\nA harsh voice hailed, from the boat astern; the lowdah answered; and so\nrapidly slid the deceptive glimmer of her bow, that before Rudolph knew\nwhether to wake his friends, or could recover, next, from the shock and\necstasy of unbelief, a tall white figure jumped or swarmed over\nthe side.\n\n\"By Jove, my dream!\" sounded the voice of Heywood, gravely. With fingers\nthat dripped gold, he tried to pat the bounding terrier. She flew up at\nhim, and tumbled back, in the liveliest danger of falling overboard.\n\"Old girl,--my dream!\"\n\nThe figure rose.\n\n\"Hallo, Rudie.\" In a daze, Rudolph gripped the wet and shining hands,\nand heard the same quiet voice: \"Rest all asleep, I suppose? Don't wake\n'em. To-morrow will do.--Have you any money on you? Toss that\nfisherman--whatever you think I'm worth. He really rowed like steam,\nyou know.\"\n\nRudolph flung his purse into the other boat. When he turned, this man\nrestored from the sea had disappeared. But he had only stolen forward,\ndog in arms, to sit beside Miss Drake. So quietly had all happened, that\nnone of the sleepers, not even the captain, was aware. Rudolph drew near\nthe two murmuring voices.\n\n\"--Couldn't help it, honestly,\" said Heywood. \"Can't describe, or\nexplain. Just something--went black inside my head, you know.\" He\npaused. \"No: don't recall seeing a thing, really, until I pitched away\nthe--what happened to be in my hands. A blank, all that. Losing your\nhead, I suppose they call it. Most extraordinary.\"\n\nThe girl's question recalled him from his puzzle.\n\n\"Do? Oh!\" He disposed of the subject easily. \"I ran, that's all.--Oh,\nyes, but I ran faster.--Not half so many as you'd suppose. Most of 'em\nwere away, burning your hospital. Saw the smoke, as I ran. All gone but\na handful. Hence those stuffed hats, Rudie, in the trench.--Only three\nof the lot could run. I merely scuttled into the next bamboo, and kept\non scuttling. No: they weren't half loaded. Oh, yes, arrow in the\nshoulder--scratch. Of course, when it came dark, I stopped running, and\nmade for the nearest fisherman. That's all.\"\n\n\"But,\" protested Rudolph, wondering, \"we heard shots.\"\n\n\"Yes, I had my Webley in my belt. Fortunately. I _told_ you: three of\nthem could run.\" The speaker patted the terrier in his lap. \"My dream,\neh, little dog? You _were_ the only one to know.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the girl: \"I knew--all the time, that--\"\n\nWhatever she meant, Rudolph could only guess; but it was true, he\nthought, that she had never once spoken as though the present meeting\nwere not possible, here or somewhere. Recalling this, he suddenly but\nquietly stepped away aft, to sit beside the steersman, and smile in\nthe darkness.\n\nThe two voices flowed on. He did not listen, but watched the phosphorus\nwelling soft and turbulent in the wake, and far off, in glimpses of the\ntropic light, the great Dragon weltering on the face of the waters. The\nshape glimmered forth, died away, like a prodigy. How ran the verse?\n\n\n\"Ich lieg' und besitze.\nLass mich schlafen.\"\n\n\n\"And yet,\" thought the young man, \"I have one pearl from his hoard.\"\nThat girl was right: like Siegfried tempered in the grisly flood, the\nraw boy was turning into a man, seasoned and invulnerable.\n\nHeywood was calling to him:--\n\n\"You must go Home with us. Do you hear? I've made a wonderful plan--with\nthe captain's fortune! Dear old Kneebone.\"\n\nA small white heap across the deck began to rise.\n\n\"How often,\" complained a voice blurred with sleep, \"how often must I\ntell ye--wake me, unless the ship--chart's all--Good God!\"\n\nAt the captain's cry, those who lay in darkness under the thatched roof\nbegan to mutter, to rise, and grope out into the trembling light, with\nsleepy cries of joy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dragon's blood, by Henry Milner Rideout\n\n*** "
