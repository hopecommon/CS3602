PAUL\n\nA Collection of Articles Written for and Published in the Daily\nPioneer Press.\n\nBy FRANK MOORE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWSPAPER STRUGGLES OF PIONEER DAYS.\n\nA BRIEF NARRATION OF INCIDENTS AND EVENTS CONNECTED WITH THE EARLY\nDAYS OF ST. PAUL, DAILY NEWSPAPERS.\n\n\nIf James M. Goodhue could revisit the earth and make a tour among the\ndaily newspaper offices of St. Paul he would discover that wonderful\nstrides had been made in the method of producing a newspaper during\nthe latter half of the past century. Among the first things to attract\nthe attention of this old-timer would be the web-perfecting press,\ncapable of producing 25,000 impressions an hour, instead of the old\nhand press of 240 impressions an hour; the linotype machine, capable\nof setting 6,000 to 10,000 ems per hour, instead of the old hand\ncompositor producing only 800 to 1,000 ems per hour, and the mailing\nmachine, enabling one man to do the work of five or six under the\nold method. Think of getting out the Sunday Pioneer Press with the\nmaterial in use fifty years ago. It would take 600 hand presses, 600\nhand pressmen and 600 boys three hours to print the edition, and as\nthere were no means of stereotyping in those days the forms would have\nto be set up 600 times, requiring the services of 5,000 compositors.\nPapers printed under these conditions would have to be sold for one\ndollar each, and there would not be much profit in it at that. The\nfirst daily papers printed in St. Paul were not conducted or a very\ngigantic scale, as the entire force of one office generally consisted\nof one pressman, five or six compositors, two editors and a business\nmanager. A few reminiscences of the trials and tribulations of the\nearly newspaper manager, editor and compositor may not be wholly\ndevoid of interest.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn 1857 there occurred in Minnesota an election of delegates to the\nconstitutional convention to provide for the admission of Minnesota\ninto the galaxy of states. The election was so close, politically,\nthat when the delegates met there was a division, and the Republicans\nand Democrats held separate conventions. At the conclusion of the work\nof the two conventions the contract for printing was awarded to the\ntwo leading papers of the state--the Pioneer and the Minnesotian--the\nPioneer to print the proceedings of the Democratic body and the\nMinnesotian that of the Republican. This contract called for the\nexpenditure of considerable money for material with which to perform\nthe work. Mr. Moore, the business manager of the Minnesotian, went to\nNew York and purchased a Hoe press, the first one ever brought to the\nstate, and a large quantity of type; also a Hoe proof press, which is\nstill in use in the Pioneer Press composing room. When the book was\nabout completed the business manager of the Minnesotian was informed\nthat an injunction had been issued prohibiting him from drawing\nany money from the state until the question of the right of the\nMinnesotian to do any state printing had been determined by the\ndistrict court. Mr. Goodrich was state printer and claimed he had a\nright to print the proceedings of both constitutional bodies. This\naction on the part of the Pioneer produced great consternation in the\nMinnesotian office, as most of the men had not received more than half\npay for some time, and now, when the balance of their pay was almost\nin sight, they were suddenly compelled to await the slow and doubtful\naction of the courts before receiving pay for their summer's work. The\ndistrict court, subsequently confirmed by the supreme court, decided\nin favor of the Minnesotian, and the day following the decision Mr.\nMoore, of the Minnesotian, brought down a bag of gold from the capitol\ncontaining $4,000, and divided it up among his employes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn 1858, when the first Atlantic cable was laid, the news was\nanxiously looked for, and nearly every inhabitant of the city turned\nout to greet the arrival of the Gray Eagle and Itasca, two of the\nfastest boats on the river, which were expected to bring the news\nof the successful laying of the cable. The Gray Eagle started from\nDubuque at 9 o'clock in the morning and the Itasca started from\nPrairie du Chien, about 100 miles farther up the river, at noon of the\nsame day. When the boats reached the bend below the river they were\nabreast of each other, and as they reached the levee it was hardly\npossible to tell which was ahead. One of the passengers on the Gray\nEagle had a copy of the Dubuque Herald containing the Queen's message,\ntied up with a small stone on the inside of it, and as he threw it to\nthe shore a messenger from the Minnesotian caught it and ran up Bench\nstreet to the Minnesotian office, where the printers were waiting,\nand the Minnesotian had the satisfaction of getting out an extra some\nlittle time before their competitors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the summer season the newspapers had to rely, to a considerable\nextent, on the steamboats for late Dubuque and Chicago papers for\ntelegraph news. There were three or four daily lines of steamers to\nSt. Paul, and every one of them could be distinguished by its whistle.\nWhen it was time for the arrival of the boat bringing the newspapers\nfrom which the different papers expected to get their telegraphic\nnews, messengers from the different offices would be at the levee, and\nas the boat neared the shore they would leap for the gangplank, and\nthere was always a scramble to get to the clerk's office first.\nJames J. Hill and the late Gus Borup were almost always at the levee\nawaiting the arrival of the steamers, but as they were after copies\nof the boats' manifest they did not come in competition with the\nadventurous kids from the newspaper offices.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minnesotian was probably the first daily paper in the West to\nillustrate a local feature. During the summer of 1859 a man by the\nname of Jackson was lynched by a mob in Wright county, and Gov. Sibley\ncalled out the Pioneer Guards to proceed to the place where the\nlynching occurred and arrest all persons connected with the tragedy.\nThe Pioneer Guards was the crack military company of the state, and\nthe only service any of its members ever expected to do was in the\nballroom or to participate in a Fourth of July parade. When they were\ncalled out by the governor there was great consternation in the ranks.\nOne of the members, who is still a prominent politician in the city,\nwhen told that his first duty was to serve his country, tremblingly\nremarked that he thought his first duty was to provide for his wife\nand family.\n\nA number of them made their wills before departing, as they thought\nthe whole of Wright county was in open rebellion. After being absent\nfor about a week they proudly marched back to the city without ever\nfiring a gun or seeing an enemy. The late J. Fletcher Williams was\ncity editor of the Minnesotian, and he wrote an extended account of\nthe expedition, and It was profusely illustrated with patent medicine\ncuts and inverted wood type and border, the only available material at\nthat time that could be procured.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe year 1859 was a memorable one in the political history of\nMinnesota. Alexander Ramsey and George L. Becker, both now living in\nthis city, were the rival candidates for governor. The Republicans\nmade extraordinary efforts to elect their state and legislative\ntickets, as both governor and United States senator were at stake.\nAmong the speakers imported by the Republicans were the Hon. Galusha\nA. Grow of Pennsylvania and Hon. Schuyler Colfax of Indiana. Mr. Grow,\nthen as now, represented the congressional district in Pennsylvania in\nwhich I formally resided, and I was very anxious to hear him, as the\nfirst political speech I had ever heard was made by him in a small\nvillage in Pennsylvania. The speakers were announced to speak at the\nold People's theater, on the corner of Fourth and St. Peter streets,\nand I was among the first to enter. The theater was packed to\noverflowing. Mr. Grow had made a very interesting speech of about an\nhour's duration, and Mr. Colfax was to follow for an equal length of\ntime. After Mr. Colfax had spoken about ten minutes an alarm of fire\nwas sounded and in less than fifteen minutes the entire structure was\nburned to the ground. This happened about 9:30 o'clock in the\nevening, and, strange to relate, not one of the morning papers had an\nannouncement of the fact the next day. The morning papers at that time\nwere something like an evening paper of to-day. They were set up and\nmade up in the afternoon and generally printed in the early part of\nthe evening. The result of that election was very gratifying to the\nRepublicans. I can see old Dr. Foster now writing a double column\npolitical head for the Minnesotian, the first two lines of which were:\n\"Shout, Republicans, Shout! We've Cleaned the Breech Clouts Out!\"\n\nDr. Foster was the editor of the Minnesotian and was quite a power in\nthe Republican party. He wielded a vigorous pen and possessed a very\nirascible temper. I have often seen him perform some Horace Greeley\nantics in the composing room of the old Minnesotian. At the time of\nthe execution of John Brown for his attempted raid into Virginia, I\nremember bringing the Chicago Tribune to the doctor, containing the\nannouncement of the execution. I had arranged the paper so that the\ndoctor could take in the contents of the heading at the first glance.\nThe doctor looked at the headlines a second and then exclaimed, loud\nenough to be heard a block, \"Great God! In the nineteenth century, a\nman hung for an idea!\"\n\nAt another time the doctor became very much enraged over some news\nthat I had laid before him. In the early 50's Galusha A. Grow, of\nPennsylvania, introduced into the house of representatives the first\nhomestead law and the Republican party soon afterward incorporated\nthe idea into their platform as one of their pet measures. After\nsuperhuman effort the bill passed the house of representatives, that\nbody being nearly tie politically, and was sent to the senate. The\nDemocratic majority in the senate was not very favorably impressed\nwith the measure, but with the assistance of the late President\nJohnson, who was senator from Tennessee at that time, the bill passed\nthe senate by a small majority. There was great rejoicing over the\nevent and no one supposed for a moment that the president would veto\nthe measure. When I laid the Chicago Tribune before the excitable\ndoctor containing the announcement of Buchanan's veto the very air was\nblue with oaths. The doctor took the paper and rushed out into the\nstreet waving the paper frantically in the air, cursing the president\nat every step.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFrom 1854, the date of the starting of the three St. Paul daily\npapers, until 1860, the time of the completion of the Winslow\ntelegraph line, there was great strife between the Pioneer,\nMinnesotian and Times as to which would be the first to appear on the\nstreet with the full text of the president's message. The messages of\nPierce and Buchanan were very lengthy, and for several days preceding\ntheir arrival the various offices had all the type of every\ndescription distributed and all the printers who could possibly be\nprocured engaged to help out on the extra containing the forthcoming\nmessage. It was customary to pay every one employed, from the devil to\nthe foreman, $2.50 in gold, and every printer in the city was notified\nto be in readiness for the approaching typographical struggle. One\nyear one of the proprietors of the Minnesotian thought he would\nsurprise the other offices, and he procured the fastest livery team In\nthe city and went down the river as far as Red Wing to intercept the\nmail coach, and expected to return to St. Paul three or four hours in\nadvance of the regular mail, which would give him that much advantage\nover his competitors. Owing to some miscalculation as to the time the\nstage left Chicago the message was delivered in St. Paul twenty-four\nhours earlier than was expected, and the proprietor of the Minnesotian\nhad the pleasure of receiving a copy of his own paper, containing the\ncomplete message, long before he returned to St. Paul. The management\nalways provided an oyster supper for the employes of the paper first\nout with the message, and it generally required a week for the typos\nto fully recover from its effect.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs an evidence of what was uppermost in the minds of most people at\nthis time, and is probably still true to-day, it may be related that\nin the spring of 1860, when the great prize fight between Heenan and\nSayers was to occur in England, and the meeting of the Democratic\nnational convention in Charleston, in which the Minnesota Democrats\nwere in hopes that their idol, Stephen A. Douglas, would be nominated\nfor president, the first question asked by the people I would meet on\nthe way from the boat landing to the office would be: \"Anything from\nthe prize fight? What is the news from the Charleston convention?\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"The good old times\" printers often talk about were evidently not the\nyears between the great panic of 1857 and the breaking out of the\nCivil war in 1861. Wages were low and there was absolutely no money to\nspeak of. When a man did occasionally get a dollar he was not sure it\nwould be worth its face value when the next boat would arrive with\na new Bank Note Reporter. Married men considered themselves very\nfortunate when they could get, on Saturday night, an order on a\ngrocery or dry goods store for four or five dollars, and the single\nmen seldom received more than $2 or $3 cash. That was not more than\nhalf enough to pay their board bill. This state of affairs continued\nuntil the Press was started in 1861, when Gov. Marshall inaugurated\nthe custom, which still prevails, of paying his employes every\nSaturday night.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAnother instance of the lack of enterprise on the part of the daily\npaper of that day:\n\nDuring the summer of 1860 a large party of Republican statesmen and\npoliticians visited St. Paul, consisting of State Senator W.H. Seward.\nSenator John P. Hale, Charles Francis Adams, Senator Nye, Gen. Stewart\nL. Woodford and several others of lesser celebrity. The party came to\nMinnesota in the interest of the Republican candidate for president.\nMr. Seward made a great speech from the front steps of the old\ncapitol, in which he predicted that at some distant day the capitol\nof this great republic would be located not far from the Falls of St.\nAnthony. There was a large gathering at the capitol to hear him, but\nthose who were not fortunate enough to get within sound of his voice\nhad to wait until the New York Herald, containing a full report of\nhis speech, reached St. Paul before they could read what the great\nstatesman had said.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the fall of 1860 the first telegraph line was completed to St.\nPaul. Newspaper proprietors thought they were then in the world, so\nfar as news is concerned, but it was not to be so. The charges for\ntelegraph news were so excessive that the three papers in St. Paul\ncould not afford the luxury of the \"latest news by Associated Press.\"\nThe offices combined against the extortionate rates demanded by the\ntelegraph company and made an agreement not to take the dispatches\nuntil the rates were lowered; but it was like an agreement of the\nrailroad presidents of the present day, it was not adhered to. The\nPioneer made a secret contract with the telegraph company and left the\nMinnesotian and the Times out in the cold. Of course that was a very\nunpleasant state of affairs and for some time the Minnesotian and\nTimes would wait until the Pioneer was out in the morning and would\nthen set up the telegraph and circulate their papers. One of the\neditors connected with the Minnesotian had an old acquaintance in the\npressroom of the Pioneer, and through him secured one of the first\npapers printed. This had been going on for some time when Earle S.\nGoodrich, the editor of the Pioneer, heard of it, and he accordingly\nmade preparation to perpetrate a huge joke on the Minnesotian. Mr.\nGoodrich was a very versatile writer and he prepared four or five\ncolumns of bogus telegraph and had it set up and two or three copies\nof the Pioneer printed for the especial use of the Minnesotian. The\nscheme worked to a charm. Amongst the bogus news was a two-column\nspeech purporting to have been made by William H. Seward in the senate\njust previous to the breaking out of the war. Mr. Seward's well-known\nideas were so closely imitated that their genuineness were not\nquestioned. The rest of the news was made up of dispatches purporting\nto be from the then excited Southern States. The Minnesotian received\na Pioneer about 4 o'clock in the morning and by 8 the entire edition\nwas distributed throughout the city. I had distributed the Minnesotian\nthroughout the upper portion of the city, and just as I returned to\nBridge Square I met the carrier of the Pioneer, and laughed at him for\nbeing so late. He smiled, but did not speak. As soon as I learned what\nhad happened I did not do either. The best of the joke was, the Times\ncould not obtain an early copy of the Pioneer and set up the bogus\nnews from the Minnesotian, and had their edition printed and ready to\ncirculate when they heard of the sell. They at once set up the genuine\nnews and circulated both the bogus and regular, and made fun of the\nMinnesotian for being so easily taken in.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Pioneer retained the monopoly of the news until the Press was\nstarted, on the 1st of January, 1861. The Press made arrangements with\nMr. Winslow for full telegraphic dispatches, but there was another\nhitch in the spring of 1861 and for some time the Press had to obtain\nits telegraph from proof sheets of the St. Anthony Falls News, a paper\npublished in what is now East Minneapolis. Gov. Marshall was very much\nexercised at being compelled to go to a neighboring town for telegraph\nnews, and one night when news of unusual importance was expected he\nhad a very stormy interview with Mr. Winslow. No one ever knew exactly\nwhat he told him, but that night the Press had full telegraphic\nreports, and has had ever since.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGov. Marshall was a noble man. When the first battle of Bull Run\noccurred the earlier reports announced a great Union victory. I\nremember of going to Dan Rice's circus that night and felt as chipper\nas a young kitten. After the circus was out I went back to the office\nto see if any late news had been received. I met Gov. Marshall at the\ndoor, and with tears rolling down his cheeks he informed me that the\nUnion force had met with a great reverse and he was afraid the\ncountry would never recover from it. But it did, and the governor\nwas afterward one of the bravest of the brave in battling for his\ncountry's honor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrinters were very patriotic, and when Father Abraham called for\n\"three hundred thousand more\" in July, 1862, so many enlisted that\nit was with much difficulty that the paper was enabled to present a\nrespectable appearance. The Press advertised for anything that could\nset type to come in and help it out. I remember one man applying\nwho said he never had set any type, but he had a good theoretical\nknowledge of the business.\n\nOne evening an old gentleman by the name of Metcalf, father of the\nlate T.M. Metcalf, came wandering into the office about 9 o'clock and\ntold the foreman he thought he could help him out. He was given a\npiece of copy and worked faithfully until the paper went to press.\nHe was over eighty years old and managed to set about 1,000 ems. Mr.\nMetcalf got alarmed at his father's absence from home and searched the\ncity over, and finally found him in the composing room of the Press.\nThe old man would not go home with his son, but insisted on remaining\nuntil the paper was up.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlthough Minnesota sent to the war as many, if not more, men than any\nother state in the Union in proportion to its population, yet it was\nnecessary to resort to a draft in a few counties where the population\nwas largely foreign. The feeling against the draft was very bitter,\nand the inhabitants of the counties which were behind in the quota did\nnot take kindly to the idea of being drafted to fight for a cause they\ndid not espouse. A riot was feared, and troops were ordered down from\nthe fort to be in readiness for any disturbance that might occur.\nArrangements for the prosecution of the draft were made as rapidly as\npossible, but the provost marshal was not in readiness to have it take\nplace on the day designated by the war department. This situation\nof affairs was telegraphed to the president and the following\ncharacteristic reply was received: \"If the draft cannot take place, of\ncourse it cannot take place. Necessity knows no law. A. Lincoln.\" The\nbitterest feeling of the anti-drafters seemed to be against the\nold St. Paul Press, a paper that earnestly advocated the vigorous\nprosecution of the war. Threats were made to mob the office. A company\nwas organized for self-defense, and Capt. E.R. Otis, now of West\nSuperior, one of the Press compositors at that time, was made post\ncommander. Capt. Otis had seen service in the early part of the war\nand the employes considered themselves fortunate in having a genuine\nmilitary man for a leader. The office was barricaded, fifteen old\nSpringfield muskets and 800 rounds of ammunition was brought down from\nthe capitol and every one instructed what to do in case of an attack.\nI slept on a lounge in the top story of the old Press building\noverlooking Bridge Square, and the guns and ammunition were under my\nbed. I was supposed to give the alarm should the mob arrive after the\nemployes had gone home. As there was no possible avenue of escape in\ncase of an attack, it looks now as if the post commander displayed\npoor judgment in placing a lone sentinel on guard. But there was no\nriot. The excitement gradually died away and the draft took place\nwithout interruption.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore and some time after the war the daily newspapers took advantage\nof all the holidays and seldom issued papers on the days following\nChristmas, New Year's, Washington's birthday, Fourth of July\nand Thanksgiving. On the Fourth of July, 1863, the Pioneer made\narrangements to move from their old quarters near the corner of Third\nand Cedar streets to the corner of Third and Robert. It happened\nthat on that day two of the greatest events of the Civil war had\noccurred--the battle of Gettysburg and the surrender of Vicksburg. The\nPioneer being engaged in moving their plant could not issue an extra\non that occasion, and the Press had the field exclusively to itself.\nThe news of these two great events had become pretty generally known\nthroughout the city and the anxiety to get fuller particulars was\nsimply intense. The Press, having a clear field for that day, did not\npropose to issue its extra until the fullest possible details had\nbeen received. A great crowd had assembled in front of the old Press\noffice, anxiously awaiting details of the great Union victories. I had\nhelped prepare the news for the press and followed the forms to the\npress room. As soon as a sufficient number of papers had been printed\nI attempted to carry them to the counting room and place them on sale.\nAs I opened the side door of the press room and undertook to reach the\ncounting room by a short circuit, I found the crowd on the outside had\nbecome so large that it was impossible to gain an entrance in that\ndirection, and undertook to retreat and try another route. But quicker\nthan a flash I was raised to the shoulders of the awaiting crowd and\nwalked on their heads to the counting room window, where I sold what\nfew papers I had as rapidly as I could hand them out. As soon as the\nmagnitude of the news got circulated cheer after cheer rent the air,\nand cannon, anvils, firecrackers and everything that would make a\nnoise was brought into requisition, and before sundown St. Paul had\ncelebrated the greatest Fourth of July in its history.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nI arrived in St. Paul on the morning of the 17th of April, 1858, and\nImmediately commenced work on the Daily Minnesotian, my brother, Geo.\nW. Moore, being part owner and manager of the paper. I had not been at\nwork long before I learned what a \"scoop\" was. Congress had passed\na bill admitting Minnesota into the Union, but as there was no\ntelegraphic communication with Washington it required two or three\ndays for the news to reach the state. The Pioneer, Minnesotian and\nTimes were morning papers, and were generally printed the evening\nbefore. It so happened that the news of the admission of Minnesota was\nbrought to St. Paul by a passenger on a late boat and the editors of\nthe Pioneer accidentally heard of the event and published the same\non the following morning, thus scooping the other two papers. The\nMinnesotian got out an extra and sent it around to their subscribers\nand they thought they had executed a great stroke of enterprise. It\nwas not long before I became familiar with the method of obtaining\nnews and I was at the levee on the arrival of every boat thereafter.\nI could tell every boat by its whistle, and there was no more scoops\n'till the telegraph line was completed in the summer of 1860.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the latter part of the Civil war the daily newspapers began to\nexpand, and have ever since kept fully abreast of the requirements of\nour rapidly increasing population. The various papers were printed on\nsingle-cylinder presses until about 1872, when double-cylinders were\nintroduced. In 1876 the first turtle-back press was brought to the\ncity, printing four pages at one time. In 1880 the different offices\nintroduced stereotyping, and in 1892 linotype type-setting machines\nwere installed. The next great advance will probably be some system of\nphotography that will entirely dispense with the work of the printer\nand proofreader. Who knows?\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIVE MILLION LOAN ELECTION.\n\nEARLY STEAMBOATING--CELEBRATION OF THE SUCCESSFUL LAYING OF THE FIRST\nATLANTIC CABLE--A FIGHT BETWEEN THE CHIPPEWAS AND SIOUXS.\n\n\n\"Right this way for the Fuller house!\" \"Right this way for the Winslow\nhouse!\" \"Right this way for the American house!\" \"Merchants hotel\non the levee!\" \"Stage for St. Anthony Falls!\" These were the\nannouncements that would greet the arrival of travelers as they would\nalight from one of the splendid steamers of the Galena, Dunleith,\nDubuque and Minnesota Packet company during the days when traveling\nby steamboat was the only way of reaching points on the upper\nMississippi. Besides the above hotels, there was the Central house,\nthe Temperance house, the City hotel, Minnesota house, the Western\nhouse, the Hotel to the Wild Hunter, whose curious sign for many years\nattracted the attention of the visitor, and many others. The Merchants\nis the only one left, and that only in name. Messengers from newspaper\noffices, representatives of storage and commission houses, merchants\nlooking for consignments of goods, residents looking for friends, and\nthe ever alert dealers in town lots on the scent of fresh victims,\nwere among the crowds that daily congregated at the levee whenever the\narrival of one of the packet company's regular steamers was expected.\nAt one time there was a daily line of steamers to La Crosse, a daily\nline to Prairie du Chien, a daily line to Dubuque and a line to St.\nLouis, and three daily lines for points on the Minnesota river.\nDoes any one remember the deep bass whistle of the Gray Eagle, the\ncombination whistle on the Key City, the ear-piercing shriek of the\nlittle Antelope, and the discordant notes of the calliope on the\nDenmark? The officers of these packets were the king's of the day, and\nwhen any one of them strayed up town he attracted as much attention as\na major general of the regulars. It was no uncommon sight to see six\nor eight steamers at the levee at one time, and their appearance\npresented a decided contrast to the levee of the present time. The\nfirst boat through the lake in the spring was granted free wharfage,\nand as that meant about a thousand dollars, there was always an\neffort made to force a passage through the lake as soon as possible.\nTraveling by steamboat during the summer months was very pleasant,\nbut it was like taking a trip to the Klondike to go East during the\nwinter. Merchants were compelled to supply themselves with enough\ngoods to last from November till April, as it was too expensive\nto ship goods by express during the winter. Occasionally some\nenterprising merchant would startle the community by announcing\nthrough the newspapers that he had just received by Burbank's express\na new pattern in dress goods, or a few cans of fresh oysters. The\nstages on most of the routes left St. Paul at 4 o'clock in the\nmorning, and subscribers to daily newspapers within a radius of forty\nmiles of the city could read the news as early as they can during\nthese wonderful days of steam and electricity.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nProbably no election ever occurred in Minnesota that excited so much\ninterest as the one known as the \"Five Million Loan Election.\" It was\nnot a party measure, as the leading men of both parties favored it;\nalthough the Republicans endeavored to make a little capital out of it\nat a later period. The only paper of any prominence that opposed the\npassage of the amendment was the Minnesotian, edited by Dr. Thomas\nFoster. That paper was very violent in its abuse of every one who\nfavored the passage of the law, and its opposition probably had an\nopposite effect from what was intended by the redoubtable doctor. The\ngreat panic of 1857 had had a very depressing effect on business\nof every description and it was contended that the passage of this\nmeasure would give employment to thousands of people; that the\nrumbling of the locomotive would soon be heard in every corner of the\nstate, and that the dealer in town lots and broad acres would again be\nable to complacently inform the newcomer the exact locality where a\nfew dollars would soon bring to the investor returns unheard of by\nany ordinary methods of speculation. The campaign was short and the\namendment carried by an immense majority. So nearly unanimous was\nthe sentiment of the community in favor of the measure that it was\nextremely hazardous for any one to express sentiments In opposition to\nit. The city of St. Paul, with a population of about 10,000, gave a\nmajority of over 4,000 for the law. There was no Australian law\nat that time, and one could vote early and often without fear of\nmolestation. One of the amusing features of the campaign, and in\nopposition to the measure, was a cartoon drawn by R.O. Sweeney, now\na resident of Duluth. It was lithographed and widely circulated. The\nnewspapers had no facilities for printing cartoons at that time. They\nhad to be printed on a hand press and folded into the papers. It was\nproposed, by the terms of this amendment to the constitution, to\ndonate to four different railroad companies $10,000 per mile for every\nmile of road graded and ready to iron. Work Was commenced soon after\nthe passage of the law, and in a short time a demand was made by the\nrailroad companies upon Gov. Sibley for the issuance of the bonds, in\naccordance with their idea of the terms of the contract made by the\nstate. Gov. Sibley declined to issue the bonds until the rights of\nthe state had been fully protected. The railroad companies would not\naccept the restrictions placed upon them by the governor, and they\nobtained a peremptory writ from the supreme court directing that they\nbe issued. The governor held that the supreme court had no authority\nto coerce the executive branch of the state government, but on the\nadvice of the attorney general, and rather than have any friction\nbetween the two branches of the government, he, in accordance with the\nmandate of the court, reluctantly signed the bonds. Judge Flandrau\ndissented from the opinion of his colleagues, and had his ideas\nprevailed the state's financial reputation would have been vastly\nimproved. Dr. Foster did not believe Gov. Sibley was sincere in his\nefforts to protect the interests of the state, and denounced him with\nthe same persistence he had during the campaign of the previous fall.\nThe doctor would never acknowledge that Gov. Sibley was the legal\ngovernor of Minnesota, and Tie contended that he had no right to sign\nthe bonds: that their issuance was illegal, and that neither the\nprincipal nor the interest would ever be paid. The Minnesotian carried\nat the head of its columns the words \"Official Paper of the City,\" and\nit was feared that its malignant attacks upon the state officials,\ndenouncing the issuance of the bonds as fraudulent and illegal, would\nbe construed abroad as reflecting the sentiment of the majority of the\npeople in the the community in which it was printed, and would have a\nbad effect in the East when the time came to negotiate the bonds. An\neffort was made to induce the city council to deprive that paper of\nits official patronage, but that body could not see its way clear to\nabrogate its contract. Threats were made to throw the office into the\nriver, but they did not materialize. When Gov. Sibley endeavored\nto place these bonds on the New York market he was confronted\nwith conditions not anticipated, and suffered disappointment and\nhumiliation in consequence of the failure of the attempt. The bonds\ncould not be negotiated. The whole railway construction scheme\nsuddenly collapsed, the railroad companies defaulted, the credit of\nthe state was compromised, \"and enterprise of great pith and\nmoment had turned their currents awry.\" The evil forbodings of the\nMinnesotian became literally true, and for more than twenty years\nthe repudiated bonds of Minnesota were a blot on the pages of her\notherwise spotless record. Nearly 250 miles of road were graded, on\nwhich the state foreclosed and a few years later donated the same to\nnew organizations. During the administration of Gov. Pillsbury the\nstate compromised with the holders of these securities and paid 50 per\ncent of their nominal value. Will she ever pay the rest?\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the latter part of May, 1858, a battle was fought near Shakopee\nbetween the Sioux and the Chippewas. A party of Chippewa warriors,\nunder the command of the famous Chief Hole-in-the-day, surprised a\nbody of Sioux on the river bottoms near Shakopee and mercilessly\nopened fire on them, killing and wounding fifteen or twenty. Eight or\nten Chippewas were killed during the engagement. The daily papers\nsent reporters to the scene of the conflict and they remained in that\nvicinity several days on the lookout for further engagements. Among\nthe reporters was John W. Sickels, a fresh young man from one of the\nEastern cities. He was attached to the Times' editorial staff and\nfurnished that paper with a very graphic description of the events of\nthe preceding days, and closed his report by saying that he was unable\nto find out the \"origin of the difficulty.\" As the Sioux and\nChippewas were hereditary enemies, his closing announcement afforded\nconsiderable amusement to the old inhabitants.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe celebration in St. Paul in honor of the successful laying of the\nAtlantic cable, which took place on the first day of September, 1858,\nwas one of the first as well as one of the most elaborate celebrations\nthat ever occurred in the city. The announcement of the completion of\nthe enterprise, which occurred on the 5th of the previous month, did\nnot reach St. Paul until two or three days later, as there was no\ntelegraphic communication to the city at that time. As soon as\nmessages had been exchanged between Queen Victoria and President\nBuchanan it was considered safe to make preparations for a grand\ncelebration. Most of the cities throughout the United States were\nmaking preparations to celebrate on that day, and St. Paul did not\npropose to be outdone. The city council appropriated several hundred\ndollars to assist in the grand jubilation and illumination. An\nelaborate program was prepared and a procession that would do credit\nto the city at the present time marched through the principal streets,\nto the edification of thousands of spectators from the city and\nsurrounding country. To show that a procession in the olden time was\nvery similar to one of the up-to-date affairs, the following order of\nprocession is appended:\n\nTHE PROCESSION.\n\n  Escort of Light Cavalry.\n  Band.\n  Pioneer Guard.\n  City Guard.\n  City Battery.\n  Floral procession with escort of Mounted Cadets,\n    representing Queen Victoria, President Buchanan,\n    the different States of the Union, and\n    other devices.\n  The Governor and State Officers in carriages.\n  The Judges of the State in carriages.\n  The Clergy.\n  Officers of the Army.\n  Officers of the Navy.\n  The Municipal Authorities of Neighboring Cities.\n  The Board of Education in Carriages.\n  The Mayor and City Council.\n  Knights Templars on Horseback.\n  Band.\n  Odd Fellows.\n  Druids.\n  Typographical Corps.\n  Band.\n  Officers and Crews of Vessels in Port.\n  Turners.\n  German Reading Society.\n  German Singing Society.\n  Attaches of Postoffice Department.\n  Citizens in Carriages.\n  Citizens on Horseback.\n  Brewers on Horseback.\n  Butchers on Horseback.\n\nCol. AC Jones, adjutant general of the state, was marshal-in-chief,\nand he was assisted by a large number of aides. The Pioneer Guards,\nthe oldest military company in the state, had the right of line. They\nhad just received their Minie rifles and bayonets, and, with the\ndrum-major headgear worn by military companies in those days,\npresented a very imposing appearance. The Pioneer Guards were followed\nby the City Guards, under Capt. John O'Gorman. A detachment of cavalry\nand the City Battery completed the military part of the affair. The\nfire department, under the superintendence of the late Charles H.\nWilliams, consisting of the Pioneer Hook and Ladder company, Minnehaha\nEngine company, Hope Engine company and the Rotary Mill company was\nthe next in order. One of the most attractive features of the occasion\nwas the contribution of the Pioneer Printing company. In a large car\ndrawn by six black horses an attempt was made to give an idea of\nprinters and printing in the days of Franklin, and also several\nepochs in the life of the great philosopher. In the car with the\nrepresentatives of the art preservative was Miss Azelene Allen, a\nbeautiful and popular young actress connected with the People's\ntheater, bearing in her hand a cap of liberty on a spear. She\nrepresented the Goddess of Liberty. The car was ornamented with\nflowers and the horses were decorated with the inscriptions\n\"Franklin,\" \"Morse,\" \"Field.\" The Pioneer book bindery was also\nrepresented in one of the floats, and workmen, both male and female,\nwere employed in different branches of the business. These beautiful\nfloats were artistically designed by George H. Colgrave, who is\nstill in the service of the Pioneer Press company. One of the unique\nfeatures of the parade, and one that attracted great attention, was a\nlight brigade, consisting of a number of school children mounted, and\nthey acted as a guard of honor to the president and queen. In an open\nbarouche drawn by four horses were seated two juvenile representatives\nof President Buchanan and Queen Victoria. The representative of\nBritish royalty was Miss Rosa Larpenteur, daughter of A.L. Larpenteur,\nand the first child born of white parents in St. Paul. James Buchanan\nwas represented by George Folsom, also a product of the city. Col.\nR.E.J. Miles and Miss Emily Dow, the stars at the People's theater,\nwere in the line of march on two handsomely caparisoned horses,\ndressed in Continental costume, representing George and Martha\nWashington. The colonel looked like the veritable Father of His\nCountry. There were a number of other floats, and nearly all the\nsecret societies of the city were in line. The procession was nearly\ntwo miles in length and they marched three and one-half hours before\nreaching their destination. To show the difference between a line of\nmarch at that time and one at the present day, the following is given:\n\nTHE LINE OF MARCH.\n\nUp St. Anthony street to Fort street, up Fort street to Ramsey street,\nthen countermarch down Fort to Fourth street, down Fourth street to\nMinnesota street, up Minnesota street to Seventh street, down Seventh\nstreet to Jackson street, up Jackson street to Eighth street, down\nEighth street to Broadway, down Broadway to Seventh street, up Seventh\nstreet to Jackson street, down Jackson street to Third street, up\nThird street to Market street.\n\nEx-Gov. W.A. Gorman and ex-Gov. Alex. Ramsey were the orators of the\noccasion, and they delivered very lengthy addresses. It had been\narranged to have extensive fireworks in the evening, but on account of\nthe storm they had to be postponed until the following night.\n\nIt was a strange coincidence that on the very day of the celebration\nthe last message was exchanged between England and America. The cable\nhad been in successful operation about four weeks and 129 messages\nwere received from England and 271 sent from America. In 1866 a new\ncompany succeeded in laying the cable which is in successful\noperation to-day. Four attempts were made before the enterprise was\nsuccessful--the first in 1857, the second in 1858, the third in 1863\nand the successful one in 1865. Cyrus W. Field, the projector of the\nenterprise, received the unanimous thanks of congress, and would have\nbeen knighted by Great Britain had Mr. Field thought it proper to\naccept such honor.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time during the early '50s a secret order known as the Sons of\nMalta was organized in one of the Eastern states, and its membership\nincreased throughout the West with as much rapidity as the Vandals and\nGoths increased their numbers during the declining years of the Roman\nEmpire. Two or three members of the Pioneer editorial staff procured a\ncharter from Pittesburg in 1858 and instituted a lodge in St. Paul.\nIt was a grand success from the start. Merchants, lawyers, doctors,\nprinters, and in fact half of the male population, was soon enrolled\nin the membership of the order. There was something so grand, gloomy\nand peculiar about the initiation that made it certain that as soon\nas one victim had run the gauntlet he would not be satisfied until\nanother one had been procured. When a candidate had been proposed for\nmembership the whole lodge acted as a committee of investigation,\nand if it could be ascertained that he had ever been derelict in his\ndealings with his fellow men he was sure to be charged with it when\nbeing examined by the high priest in the secret chamber of the\norder--that is, the candidate supposed he was in a secret chamber from\nthe manner in which he had to be questioned, but when the hood had\nbeen removed from his face he found, much to his mortification, that\nhis confession had been made to the full membership of the order.\nOccasionally the candidate would confess to having been more of a\ntransgresser than his questioners had anticipated.\n\nThe following is a sample of the questions asked a candidate for\nadmission: Grand Commander to candidate, \"Are you in favor of\nthe acquisition of the Island of Cuba?\" Candidate, \"I am.\" Grand\nCommander, \"In case of an invasion of the island, would you lie awake\nnights and steal into the enemy's camp?\" Candidate, \"I would.\" Grand\nCommander, \"Let it be recorded, he will lie and steal,\" and then an\nimmense gong at the far end of the hall would be sounded and the\ncandidate would imagine that the day of judgment had come. The scheme\nof bouncing candidates into the air from a rubber blanket, so popular\nduring the days of the recent ice carnivals was said to have been\noriginal with the Sons of Malta, and was one of the mildest of the\nmany atrocities perpetrated by this most noble order.\n\nSome time during the summer a large excursion party of members of the\norder from Cincinnati, Chicago and Milwaukee visited St. Paul.\nAmong the number was the celebrated elocutionist, Alf. Burnett of\nCincinnati, and Gov. Alexander Randall of Wisconsin. They arrived at\nthe lower levee about midnight and marched up Third street to the hall\nof the order, where a grand banquet was awaiting them. The visitors\nwere arrayed in long, black robes, with a black hood over their heads,\nand looked more like the prisoners in the play of \"Lucretia Borgia\"\nthan members of modern civilization.\n\nOn the following day there was an immense barbecue at Minnehaha\nFalls, when the visitors were feasted with an ox roasted whole. This\norganization kept on increasing in membership, until in an evil hour\none of the members had succeeded in inducing the Rev. John Penman\nto consent to become one of its members. Mr. Penman was so highly\nIndignant at the manner in which he had been handled during the\ninitiation that he immediately wrote an expose of the secret work,\nwith numerous illustrations, and had it published in Harper's Weekly.\nThe exposition acted like a bombshell in the camp of the Philistines,\nand ever after Empire hall, the headquarters of the order, presented\na dark and gloomy appearance. The reverend gentleman was judge of\nprobate of Ramsey county at the time, but his popularity suddenly\ndiminished and when his term of office expired he found it to his\nadvantage to locate in a more congenial atmosphere.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Minnesotian and Times, although both Republican papers, never\ncherished much love for each other. The ravings of the Eatanswill\nGazette were mild in comparison to the epithets used by these little\npapers in describing the shortcomings of their \"vile and reptile\ncontemporary.\" After the election in 1859, as soon as it was known\nthat the Republicans had secured a majority in the legislature, the\nmanagers of these rival Republican offices instituted a very lively\ncampaign for the office of state printer. Both papers had worked hard\nfor the success of the Republican ticket and they had equal claims\non the party for recognition. Both offices were badly in need of\nfinancial assistance, and had the Republican party not been successful\none of them, and perhaps both, would have been compelled to suspend.\nHow to divide the patronage satisfactorily to both papers was the\nproblem that confronted the legislature about to assemble. The war of\nwords between Foster and Newson continued with unabated ferocity. The\neditor of the Minnesotian would refer to the editor of the Times\nas \"Mr. Timothy Muggins Newson\"--his right name being Thomas M.\nNewson--and the Times would frequently mention Dr. Foster as the\n\"red-nosed, goggle-eyed editor of the Minnesotian.\" To effect a\nreconciliation between these two editors required the best diplomatic\ntalent of the party leaders. After frequent consultations between the\nleading men of the party and the managers of the two offices, it was\narranged that the papers should be consolidated and the name of the\npaper should be the Minnesotian and Times. It can readily be seen\nthat a marriage contracted under these peculiar circumstances was\nnot likely to produce a prolonged state of connubial felicity. The\nrelations between Foster and Newson were no more cordial under one\nmanagement than had hitherto existed when the offices were separate.\nThis unhappy situation continued until about the time the legislature\nadjourned, when the partnership was dissolved. Dr. Foster assumed\nentire control of the Minnesotian and Maj. Newson was manager of\nthe Times. George W. Moore was associated with Dr. Foster in the\npublication of the Minnesotian prior to the consolidation, but when\nthe offices separated it was stipulated that Mr. Moore should have the\nprinting of the Journals of the two houses of the legislature as part\npayment of his share of the business of the late firm of Newson,\nMoore, Foster & Co., thus entirely severing his relations with the\npaper he helped to found. After the arrangement was made it was with\nthe greatest difficulty that it was carried into effect, as Orville\nBrown of Faribault had entered the field as a candidate for state\nprinter and came within a few votes of taking the printing to that\nvillage. The Times continued under the management of Mr. Newson until\nthe first of January, 1861, when he leased the office to W.R. Marshall\nand Thomas F. Slaughter, who started the St. Paul Daily Press with\nits material. The Press proved to be too much of a competitor for the\nMinnesotian, and in a short time Dr. Foster was compelled to surrender\nto its enterprising projectors, they having purchased the entire\nplant. This ended the rivalry between the two Republican dailies. Dr.\nFoster and Maj. Newson, some time afterward, received commissions in\nthe volunteer service of the army during the Civil war, and George W.\nMoore was appointed collector of the port of St. Paul, a position he\nheld for more than twenty years.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDoes any one remember that St. Paul had a paper called the Daily North\nStar? The historians of St. Paul and Ramsey county do not seem to ever\nhave chronicled the existence of this sprightly little sheet. During\nthe presidential campaign of 1860 we had two kinds of Democrats--the\nDouglas and the Breckinridge or administration Democrats. There\nwere only two papers in the state that espoused the cause of\nMr. Breckinridge--the Chatfield Democrat and the Henderson\nIndependent--and as they had been designated by the president to\npublish such portion of the acts of congress as it was customary\nto print at that time, it was quite natural that they carried the\nadministration colors at the head of their columns. They were called\n\"bread and butter papers.\" The supporters of Mr. Breckinridge thought\ntheir cause would present a more respectable appearance if they had an\norgan at the capital of the state. Accordingly the late H.H. Young,\nthe editor of the Henderson Independent, was brought down from that\nvillage and the Daily North Star soon made its appearance. It was not\nnecessary at that time to procure the Associated Press dispatches, a\nperfecting press and linotype machines before embarking in a daily\nnewspaper enterprise, as a Washington hand press and five or six\ncases of type were all that were necessary. This paper was published\nregularly until after election, and as the returns indicated that the\nofficeholders would not much longer contribute toward its support it\nsoon collapsed.\n\nSt. Paul had another paper that is very seldom mentioned in newspaper\nhistory. It was called the St. Paul Weekly Journal, and was edited by\nDr. Massey, formerly of the Ohio Statesman and private secretary to\nGov. Sam Medary. This paper was started in 1862, but on account of its\nviolent opposition to the prosecution of the war did not meet with\nmuch favor, and only existed about eight months.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSome time during the year 1858 the Minnesotian office received about\nhalf a dozen cases of very bad whisky in payment of a very bad debt.\nThey could not sell it--they could not even give it to any one.\nOccasionally the thirst of an old-time compositor would get the\nbetter of him and he would uncork a bottle. The experiment was never\nrepeated. Think of half a dozen cases of whisky remaining unmolested\nin a printing office for more than two years. During the campaign\nof 1860 the Wide Awakes and the Little Giants were the uniformed\npolitical organizations intended to attract the attention of voters.\nOne dreary night one of the attaches of the Minnesotian office, and an\nactive member of the Wide Awakes, met the Little Giants near Bridge\nSquare as they were returning to their hall after a long march.\nIn order to establish a sort of entente cordiale between the two\norganisations the Little Giants were invited over to the Minnesotian\noffice in hopes they would be able to reduce the supply of this\nnauseating beverage. It was a golden opportunity. The invitation was\nreadily accepted, and in a short time fifty ardent followers of the\nadvocate of squatter sovereignty were lined up in front of a black\nRepublican office, thirsting for black Republican whisky. Bottle after\nbottle, was passed down the line, and as it gurgled down the throats\nof these enthusiastic marchers they smacked their lips with as much\ngusto as did Rip Van Winkle when partaking of the soporific potation\nthat produced his twenty years' sleep. One of the cardinal principles\nof the Democracy, at that time was to \"love rum and hate <DW65>s.\" As\nthe entire stock was disposed of before the club resumed its line of\nmarch, the host of the occasion concluded that at least one plank of\ntheir platform was rigidly adhered to.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862.\n\nNARRATION OF SOME OF THE EXCITING EVENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE\nGREAT SIOUX OUTBREAK IN 1862--FORT RIDGELY, NEW ULM AND BIRCH\nCOULIE--OTHER DAY AND WABASHA--GREAT EXCITEMENT IN ST. PAUL.\n\n\nIn July and August, 1862, President Lincoln issued proclamations\ncalling for the enlistment of 600,000 volunteers for the purpose of\nreinforcing the army, then vainly endeavoring to suppress the Southern\nrebellion. It was probably one of the most gloomy periods in the\nhistory of the Civil war. McClellan had been compelled to make a\nprecipitous and disastrous retreat from the vicinity of Richmond;\nthe army of Northern Virginia under Pope had met with several severe\nreverses; the armies in the West under Grant, Buell and Curtis had not\nbeen able to make any progress toward the heart of the Confederacy;\nrebel marauders under Morgan were spreading desolation and ruin in\nKentucky and Ohio; rebel privateers were daily eluding the vigilant\nwatch of the navy and escaping to Europe with loads of cotton, which\nthey readily disposed of and returned with arms and ammunition to aid\nin the prosecution of their cause. France was preparing to invade\nMexico with a large army for the purpose of forcing the establishment\nof a monarchical form of government upon the people of our sister\nrepublic; the sympathies of all the great powers of Europe, save\nRussia, were plainly manifested by outspoken utterances favorable to\nthe success of the Confederate cause; rumors of foreign intervention\nin behalf of the South were daily circulated; the enemies of the\ngovernment in the North were especially active in their efforts\nto prevent the enlistment of men under the call of the president;\nconspiracies for burning Northern cities had been unearthed by\ngovernment detectives, and emissaries from the South were endeavoring\nto spread disease and pestilence throughout the loyal North. It was\nduring this critical period in the great struggle for the suppression\nof the Rebellion that one of the most fiendish atrocities in the\nhistory of Indian warfare was enacted on the western boundaries of\nMinnesota.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt can readily be seen that the government was illy prepared to cope\nwith an outbreak of such magnitude as this soon proved to be. By the\nterms of the treaty of Traverse des Sioux and Mendota in 1851 the\nSioux sold all their lands in Minnesota, except a strip ten miles wide\non each side of the Minnesota river from near Fort Ridgely to Big\nStone lake. In 1858 ten miles of the strip lying north of the river\nwas sold, mainly through the influence of Little Crow. The selling of\nthis strip caused great dissatisfaction among the Indians and Little\nCrow was severely denounced for the part he took in the transaction.\nThe sale rendered it necessary for all the Indians to locate on the\nsouth side of the Minnesota, where game was scarce and trapping poor.\nThere was nothing for them to live upon unless they adopted the habits\nof civilization and worked like white men. This was very distasteful\nto many of them, as they wanted to live the same as they did before\nthe treaty--go where they pleased, when they pleased, and hunt game\nand sell fur to traders. The government built houses for those who\ndesired to occupy them, furnished tools, seed, etc., and taught them\nhow to farm. At two of the agencies during the summer of the outbreak\nthey had several hundred acres of land under cultivation. The\ndisinclination of many of the Indians to work gradually produced\ndissension among themselves and they formed into two parties--the\nwhite man's party, those that believed in cultivating the soil; and\nthe Indian party, a sort of young-man-afraid-of-work association, who\nbelieved it beneath the dignity of the noble Dakotan to perform\nmanual labor. The white man's, or farmer's party, was favored by the\ngovernment, some of them having fine houses built for them. The other\nIndians did not like this, and became envious of them because they\ndiscontinued the customs of the tribe. There was even said to have\nbeen a secret organization among the tepee Indians whose object it was\nto declare war upon the whites. The Indians also claimed that they\nwere not fairly dealt with by the traders; that they had to rely\nentirely upon their word for their indebtedness to them; that they\nwere ignorant of any method of keeping accounts, and that when the\npaymaster came the traders generally took all that was coming, and\noften leaving many of them in debt. They protested against permitting\nthe traders to sit at the pay table of the government paymaster and\ndeduct from their small annuities the amount due them. They had at\nleast one white man's idea--they wanted to pay their debts when they\ngot ready.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nFor several weeks previous to the outbreak the Indians came to the\nagencies to get their money. Day after day and week after week passed\nand there was no sign of paymasters. The year 1862 was the the second\nyear of the great Rebellion, and as the government officers had been\ntaxed to their utmost to provide funds for the prosecution of the war,\nit looked as though they had neglected their wards in Minnesota. Many\nof the Indians who had gathered about the agencies were out of money\nand their families were suffering. The Indians were told that on\naccount of the great war in which the government was engaged the\npayment would never be made. Their annuities were payable in gold and\nthey were told that the great father had no gold to pay them with.\nMaj. Galbraith, the agent of the Sioux, had organized a company to go\nSouth, composed mostly of half-breeds, and this led the Indians to\nbelieve that now would be the time to go to war with the whites and\nget their land back. It was believed that the men who had enlisted\nlast had all left the state and that before, help could be sent they\ncould clear the country of the whites, and that the Winnebagos and\nChippewas would come to their assistance. It is known that the Sioux\nhad been in communication with Hole-in-the-Day, the Chippewa chief,\nbut the outbreak was probably precipitated before they came to an\nunderstanding. It was even said at the time that the Confederate\ngovernment had emissaries among them, but the Indians deny this report\nand no evidence has ever been collected proving its truthfulness.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nUnder the call of the president for 600,000 men Minnesota was called\nupon to furnish five regiments--the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth\nand Tenth--and the requisition had been partially filled and the men\nmustered in when the news reached St. Paul that open hostilities had\ncommenced at the upper agency, and an indiscriminate massacre of the\nwhites was taking place.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe people of Minnesota had been congratulating themselves that\nthey were far removed from the horrors of the Civil war, and their\nindignation knew no bounds when compelled to realize that these\ntreacherous redskins, who had been nursed and petted by officers\nof the government, and by missionaries and traders for years, had,\nwithout a moment's warning, commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of\nmen, women and children. It was a singular fact that farmer Indians,\nwhom the government officers and missionaries had tried so hard\nto civilize, were guilty of the most terrible butcheries after\nhostilities had actually commenced.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nA few days previous to the attack upon the whites at the upper agency\na portion of the band of Little Six appeared at Action, Meeker county.\nThere they murdered several people and then fled to Redwood. It was\nthe first step in the great massacre that soon followed. On the\nmorning of the 18th of August, without a word of warning, an\nindiscriminate massacre was inaugurated. A detachment of Company B of\nthe Fifth regiment, under command of Capt. Marsh, went to the scene\nof the revolt, but they were ambushed and about twenty-five of their\nnumber, including the captain, killed. The horrible work of murder,\npillage and destruction was spread throughout the entire Sioux\nreservation, and whole families, especially those in isolated portions\nof the country, were an easy prey to these fiendish warriors.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Wyoming massacre during the Revolution and the Black Hawk and\nSeminole wars at a later period, pale into insignificance when\ncompared to the great outrages committed by these demons during this\nterrible outbreak. In less than one week 1,000 people had been killed,\nseveral million dollars' worth of property destroyed and 30,000 people\nrendered homeless. The entire country from Fort Ripley to the southern\nboundary of the state, reaching almost to the mouth of the Minnesota\nriver, had been in a twinkling depopulated. How to repel these\ninvaders and drive them back to their reservations and out of the\nstate as they had forfeited all rights to the land they had occupied,\nwas the problem that suddenly confronted both the state and national\nauthorities.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nShortly after the news of the outbreak at Redwood had been received,\nword was sent from Fort Ripley to the effect that the Chippewas were\nassuming a warlike attitude, and it was feared that the Sioux and\nChippewas--hereditary enemies--had buried the hatchet, or had been\ninfluenced by other causes, and were ready to co-operate in an\nindiscriminate massacre of the whites. Indian Agent Walker undertook\nto arrest the famous chief Hole-in-the-day, but that wily warrior had\nscented danger and suddenly disappeared, with his entire band, which\ncaused grave apprehension among the settlers in that locality, and\nthey were in daily dread of an attack from these hitherto peaceable\ntribes.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe suddenness with which the outbreak had occurred and the\nextraordinary rapidity with which it spread, driving the defenseless\nsettlers from their homes and causing desolation and ruin on every\nside, rendered it necessary for the governor to call an extra session\nof the legislature for the purpose of devising means to arm and equip\nvolunteers, and assist the homeless refugees in procuring places of\nshelter where they would be safe from molestation by these dusky\nwarriors. Could anything be more terrible than Gov. Ramsey's picture\nof the ravages of these outlaws in his message to the legislature?\n\"Nothing which the brutal lust and wanton cruelty of these savages\ncould wreak upon their helpless and innocent victims was omitted from\nthe category of their crimes,\" said the governor. \"Helplessness and\ninnocence, indeed, which would inspire pity in any heart but theirs,\nseemed to inspire them only with a more fiendish rage. Infants hewn\ninto bloody chips of flesh or torn untimely from the womb of the\nmurdered mother, and in cruel mockery cast in fragments on her\npulseless and bleeding breast; rape joined to murder in one awful\ntragedy; young girls, even children of tender years, outraged by\nthese brutal ravishers till death ended their shame; women held into\ncaptivity to undergo the horrors of a living death; whole families\nburned alive; and, as if their devilish fancy could not glut itself\nwith outrages on the living, the last efforts exhausted in mutilating\nthe bodies of the dead. Such are the spectacles, and a thousand\nnameless horrors besides which this first experience of Indian\nwarfare has burned into the minds and hearts of our frontier people;\nand such the enemy with whom we have to deal.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe old saying that the only good Indians are dead ones had a noble\nexception in the person of Other Day, who piloted sixty-two men,\nwomen and children across the country from below Yellow Medicine to\nKandiyohi, and from there to Hutchinson, Glencoe and Carver. Other Day\nwas an educated Indian and had been rather wild in his younger days,\nbut experienced a change of heart about four years before the outbreak\nand had adopted the habits of civilization. Other Day arrived in St.\nPaul a few days after he had piloted his party in safety to Carver,\nand in the course of a few remarks to a large audience at Ingersoll\nhall, which had assembled for the purpose of organizing a company of\nhome guards, he said: \"I am a Dakota Indian, born and reared in the\nmidst of evil. I grew up without the knowledge of any good thing. I\nhave been instructed by Americans and taught to read and write. This\nI found to be good. I became acquainted with the Sacred Writings, and\nthus learned my vileness. At the present time I have fallen into great\nevil and affliction, but have escaped from it, and with sixty-two men,\nwomen and children, without moccasins, without food and without a\nblanket, I have arrived in the midst of a great people, and now my\nheart is glad. I attribute it to the mercy of the Great Spirit.\" Other\nDay had been a member of the church for several years and his religion\ntaught him that the Great Spirit approved his conduct.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was apparent that the Indian war was on in earnest. Ex-Gov. Sibley,\non account of his long familiarity with Indian character, was placed\nin command of the troops ordered to assemble at St. Peter, and in\na few days, with detachments of the regiments then forming,\nhalf-uniformed, poorly armed and with a scant supply of ammunition,\ncommenced offensive operations against the murderous redskins. The\nnewspapers and the people were crying \"On to Ridgely!\" which was then\nbeleaguered, with the same persistency as did Horace Greeyley howl \"On\nto Richmond!\" previous to the disaster at Bull Run.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAny one who has seen the thrilling realistic Indian play of \"The Girl\nI Left Behind Me\" can form some idea of the terrible suspense of the\nlittle garrison at Port Ridgely previous to being relieved by the\nforces under command of Gen. Sibley. Fort Ridgely was a fort only\nin name, and consisted of two or three stone and several wooden\nbuildings, surrounded by a fence, which did not afford much protection\nwhen attacked by a large force. The garrison was under the command of\nLieut. T.J. Sheehan. His force consisted of about 150 men from the\nFifth regiment, fifty men of the Renville Rangers, and a number of\ncivilians. He was surrounded by 700 or 800 Sioux, fully armed and\nequipped. Although there were only two attempts made to capture the\ngarrison by assault, yet the siege was kept up for several days. In\naddition to about 300 refugees who had gathered there for support\nand protection, the $72,000 of annuity money, which had been so long\nexpected, arrived there the day before the outbreak. After bravely\ndefending the fort for more than a week, the little garrison was\nrelieved by the arrival of about 200 mounted volunteers under command\nof Col. McPhail, being the advance of Gen. Sibley's command. During\nthe siege many of the men became short of musketry ammunition, and\nspherical case shot were opened in the barracks and women worked with\nbusy hands making cartridges, while men cut nail rods in short pieces\nand used them as bullets, their dismal whistling producing terror\namong the redskins.\n\nAlmost simultaneously with the attack on Fort Ridgely the Indians in\nlarge numbers appeared in the vicinity of New Ulm, with the evident\nintention of burning and pillaging the village. Judge Charles E.\nFlandrau of this city, who was then residing at St. Peter, organized a\ncompany of volunteers and marched across the country to the relief of\nthat place. The judge received several acquisitions to his force while\nen route, and when he arrived at New Ulm found himself in command of\nabout 300 men, poorly armed and wholly without military experience.\nThey arrived at New Ulm just in time to assist the inhabitants in\ndriving the Indians from the upper part of the village, several\ncitizens having been killed and a number of houses burned. Two or\nthree days afterward the Indians appeared in large force, surrounded\nthe town and commenced burning the buildings on its outskirts. After\na desperate encounter, in which the force under command of Judge\nFlandrau lost ten killed and about forty wounded, the Indians retired.\nThere were in the village at the time of the attack about 1,200 or\n1,500 noncombatants, and every one of them would have been killed had\nthe Indian attack been successful. Provisions and ammunition becoming\nscarce, the judge decided to evacuate the town and march across the\ncountry to Mankato. They made up a train of about 150 wagons, loaded\nthem with women and children and the men who had been wounded in the\nfight, and arrived safely in Mankato without being molested. Nearly\ntwo hundred houses were burned before the town was evacuated, leaving\nnothing standing but a few houses inside the hastily constructed\nbarricade. The long procession of families leaving their desolated\nhomes, many of them never to return, formed one of the saddest scenes\nin the history of the outbreak, and will ever be remembered by the\ngallant force under the command of Judge Flandrau, who led them to a\nplace of safety.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Gen. Sibley arrived at Fort Ridgely a detail of Company A\nof the Sixth regiment, under command of Capt. H.P. Grant of St. Paul,\nand seventy members of the Cullen Guards, under the command of Capt.\nJo Anderson, also of St. Paul, and several citizen volunteers,\nall under the command of Maj. Joseph R. Brown, was sent out with\ninstructions to bury the dead and rescue the wounded, if any could\nbe found, from their perilous surroundings. They were St. Paul\norganizations and most all of their members were St. Paul boys. They\nnever had had an opportunity to drill and most of them were not\nfamiliar with the use of firearms. After marching for two days, during\nwhich time they interred a large number of victims of the savage\nSioux, they went into camp at Birch Coulie, about fifteen miles from\nFort Ridgely. The encampment was on the prairie near a fringe of\ntimber and the coulie on one side and an elevation of about ten feet\non the other. It was a beautiful but very unfortunate location for the\ncommand to camp, and would probably not have been selected had it been\nknown that they were surrounded by 400 or 500 hostile warriors. Maj.\nBrown had about one hundred and fifty men under his command. About 4\no'clock on the following morning the Indians, to the number of 500 or\n600, well armed and most of them mounted, commenced an indiscriminate\nfire upon the almost helpless little command. For two days they\nbravely defended themselves, and when relief finally arrived it was\nfound that about half their number had been killed or wounded. When\nthe news of the disaster reached St. Paul there was great excitement.\nRelatives and friends of the dead and wounded were outspoken in\ntheir denunciation of the civil and military authorities who were\nresponsible for this great sacrifice of the lives of our citizens. It\nwas feared that the city itself was in danger of an attack from the\nsavages. Home guards were organized and the bluffs commanding a view\nof the city were nightly patrolled by citizen volunteers. There was no\ntelegraph at that time and rumors of all sorts were flying thick\nand fast. Every courier reaching the city would bring news of fresh\noutrages, and our panic-stricken citizens had hardly time to recover\nfrom the effect of one disaster before the news of another would be\nreceived. Settlers fleeing from their homes for places of safety were\narriving by the score, leaving crops to perish in the field and their\nhouses to be destroyed. The situation was appalling, and many of our\ncitizens were predicting the most direful results should the army fail\nto check the savage hordes in their work of devastation and ruin.\n\nEvery boat from the Minnesota river would be crowded with refugees,\nand the people of St. Paul were often called upon to assist in\nforwarding them to their place of destination.\n\nHome guards were organized in almost every village of the threatened\nportion of the state, but the authorities could not furnish arms\nor ammunition and their services would have been of little account\nagainst the well-armed savages in case they had been attacked.\n\nAdvertisements appeared in the St. Paul newspapers offering rewards of\n$25 a piece for Sioux scalps.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGov. Ramsey endeavored to allay the apprehensions of the people and\npublished in the papers a statement to the effect that the residents\nof the Capital City need not be alarmed, as the nearest approach of\nthe Indians was at Acton, Meeker county, 80 miles away; Fort Ripley,\n150 miles away, and the scenes of the tragedy in Yellow Medicine\ncounty, 210 miles distant. This may have been gratifying to the\nresidents of the Capital City, but was far from reassuring to the\nfrontiersmen who were compelled to abandon their homes and were\nseeking the protection of the slowly advancing militia.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAbout 12 o'clock one night during the latter part of August a report\nwas circulated over the northern and western portion of St. Paul that\nthe savages were near the city, and many women and children were\naroused from their slumber and hastily dressed and sought the\nprotection of the city authorities. It was an exciting but rather\namusing episode in the great tragedy then taking place on the\nfrontier. Rumors of this character were often circulated, and it was\nnot until after the battle of Wood Lake that the people of St. Paul\nfelt that they were perfectly safe from raids by the hostile Sioux.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAs soon as Gen. Sibley had collected a sufficient force to enable\nhim to move with safety he decided upon offensive operations. He had\ncollected about 2,000 men from the regiments then forming, including\nthe Third regiment, recently paroled, and a battery under command of\nCapt. Mark Hendricks. The expedition marched for two or three days\nwithout encountering opposition, but on the morning of the 23d of\nSeptember several foraging parties belonging to the Third regiment\nwere fired upon in the vicinity of Wood Lake. About 800 of the command\nwere engaged in the encounter and were opposed by about an equal\nnumber of Indians. After a spirited engagement Col. Marshall, with\nabout 400 men, made a double-quick charge upon the Sioux and succeeded\nin utterly routing them. Our loss was four killed and forty or fifty\nwounded. This was the only real battle of the war. Other Day was with\nthe whites and took a conspicuous part in the encounter. After\nthe battle Gen. Pope, who was in command of the department of the\nNorthwest, telegraphed the war department that the Indian war was\nover and asked what disposition to make of the troops then under his\ncommand. This request of Gen. Pope was met with a decided remonstrance\nby the people of Minnesota, and they succeeded in preventing the\nremoval of any of the troops until they had made two long marches\nthrough the Dakotas and to Montana. Gen. Sibley's command reached Camp\nRelease on the 26th of September, in the vicinity of which was\nlocated a large camp of Indians, most of whom had been engaged in the\nmassacres. They had with them about two hundred and fifty mixed bloods\nand white women and children, and the soldiers were very anxious to\nprecede at once to their rescue. Gen. Sibley was of the opinion that\nany hostile demonstration would mean the annihilation of all the\nprisoners, and therefore proceeded with the utmost caution. After a\nfew preliminary consultations the entire camp surrendered and the\ncaptives were released. As soon as possible Gen. Sibley made inquiries\nas to the participation of these Indians in the terrible crimes\nrecently perpetrated, and it soon developed that a large number of\nthem had been guilty of the grossest atrocities. The general decided\nto form a military tribunal and try the offenders. After a series of\nsittings, lasting from the 30th of September to the 5th of November,\n321 of the fiends were found guilty of the offenses charged, 303 of\nwhom were sentenced to death and the rest condemned to various terms\nof imprisonment according to their crimes. All of the condemned\nprisoners were taken to Mankato and were confined in a large jail\nconstructed for the purpose. After the court-martial had completed\nits work and the news of its action had reached the Eastern cities,\na great outcry was made that Minnesota was contemplating a wholesale\nslaughter of the beloved red man. The Quakers of Philadelphia and the\ngood people of Massachusetts sent many remonstrances to the president\nto put a stop to the proposed wholesale execution. The president,\nafter consulting his military advisers, decided to permit the\nexecution of only thirty-eight of the most flagrant cases, and\naccordingly directed them to be hung on the 26th of December, 1862.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nPrevious to their execution the condemned prisoners were interviewed\nby Rev. S.R. Riggs, to whom they made their dying confessions. Nearly\nevery one of them claimed to be innocent of the crimes charged to\nthem. Each one had some word to send to his parents or family, and\nwhen speaking of their wives and children almost every one was\naffected to tears. Most of them spoke confidently of their hope of\nsalvation, and expected to go at once to the abode of the Great\nSpirit. Rattling Runner, who was a son-in-law of Wabasha, dictated the\nfollowing letter, which is a sample of the confessions made to Dr.\nRiggs: \"Wabasha, you have deceived me. You told me if we followed the\nadvice of Gen. Sibley and gave ourselves up, all would be well--no\ninnocent man would be injured. I have not killed or injured a white\nman or any white person. I have not participated in the plunder of\ntheir property; and yet to-day I am set apart for execution and must\ndie, while men who are guilty will remain in prison. My wife is your\ndaughter, my children are your grandchildren. I leave them all in your\ncare and under your protection. Do not let them suffer, and when they\nare grown up let them know that their father died because he followed\nthe advice of his chief, and without having the blood of a white man\nto answer for to the Holy Spirit. My wife and children are dear to me.\nLet them not grieve for me; let them remember that the brave should be\nprepared to meet death, and I will do as becomes a Dakotah.\"\n\nWabasha was a Sioux chief, and although he was not found guilty of\nparticipating in any of the massacres of women and children, he was\nprobably in all the most important battles. Wabasha county, and\nWabasha street in St. Paul were named after his father.\n\nAfter the execution the bodies were taken down, loaded into wagons and\ncarried down to a sandbar in front of the city, where they were all\ndumped into the same hole. They did not remain there long, but were\nspirited away by students and others familiar with the use of a\ndissecting knife.\n\nLittle Crow, the chief instigator of the insurrection was not with the\nnumber that surrendered, but escaped and was afterward killed by a\nfarmer named Lamson, in the vicinity of Hutchinson. His scalp is now\nin the state historical society. Little Crow was born in Kaposia, a\nfew miles below St. Paul, and was always known as a bad Indian. Little\nCrow's father was friendly to the whites, and it was his dying wish\nthat his son should assume the habits of civilized life and accustom\nhimself to the new order of things, but the dying admonitions of the\nold man were of little avail and Little Crow soon became a dissolute,\nquarrelsome and dangerous Indian. He was opposed to all change of\ndress and habits of life, and was very unfriendly to missionaries and\nteachers. He was seldom known to tell the truth and possessed very few\nredeeming qualities. Although greatly disliked by many of the Indians,\nhe was the acknowledged head of the war party and by common consent\nassumed the direction of all the hostile tribes in their fruitless\nstruggle against the whites.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBetween the conviction and execution of the condemned Indians there\nwas great excitement throughout the Minnesota valley lest the\npresident should pardon the condemned. Meetings were held throughout\nthe valley and organizations were springing into existence for the\npurpose of overpowering the strong guard at Mankato and wreaking\nsummary justice upon the Indians. The situation became so serious\npending the decision of the president that the governor was compelled\nto issue a proclamation calling upon all good citizens not to tarnish\nthe fair name of the state by an act of lawlessness that the outside\nworld would never forget, however great was the provocation. When\nthe final order came to execute only thirty-eight there was great\ndisappointment. Petitions were circulated in St. Paul and generally\nsigned favoring the removal of the condemned Indians to Massachusetts\nto place them under the refining influence of the constituents of\nSenator Hoar, the same people who are now so terribly shocked because\na humane government is endeavoring to prevent, in the Philippines, a\nrepetition of the terrible atrocities committed in Minnesota.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe balance of the condemned were kept in close confinement till\nspring, when they were taken to Davenport, and afterward to some point\non the Missouri river, where a beneficent government kindly permitted\nthem to sow the seed of discontent that finally culminated in the\nCuster massacre. When it was known that the balance of the condemned\nIndians were to be transported to Davenport by steamer. St. Paul\npeople made preparations to give them a warm reception as they passed\ndown the river, but their intentions were frustrated by the government\nofficers in charge of their removal, as they arranged to have the\nsteamer Favorite, on which they were to be transported, pass by the\ncity in the middle of the night. St. Paul people were highly indignant\nwhen apprised of their escape.\n\nLittle Six and Medicine Bottle, two Sioux chiefs engaged in the\noutbreak, were arrested at Fort Gary (Winnipeg), and delivered at\nPembina in January, 1864, and were afterward taken to Fort Snelling,\nwhere they were tried, condemned and executed in the presence of\n10,000 people, being the last of the Indians to receive capital\npunishment for their great crimes. Little Six confessed to having\nmurdered fifty white men, women and children.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne of the most perplexing problems the military authorities had to\ncontend with was the transportation of supplies to the troops on the\nfrontier. There were, of course, no railroads, and the only way to\ntransport provisions was by wagon. An order was issued by the military\nauthorities requesting the tender of men and teams for this purpose,\nbut the owners of draft horses did not respond with sufficient\nalacrity to supply the pressing necessities of the army, and it\nwas necessary for the authorities to issue another order forcibly\nimpressing into service of the government any and all teams that could\nbe found on the streets or in stables. A detachment of Company K of\nthe Eighth regiment was sent down from the fort and remained in the\ncity several days on that especial duty. As soon as the farmers heard\nthat the government was taking possession of everything that came over\nthe bridge they ceased hauling their produce to the city and carried\nit to Hastings. There was one silver-haired farmer living near the\ncity limits by the name of Hilks, whose sympathies were entirely with\nthe South, and he had boasted that all of Uncle Sam's hirelings could\nnot locate his team. One of the members of Company K was a former\nneighbor of the disloyal farmer, and he made it his particular duty\nto see that this team, at least, should be loyal to the government. A\nclose watch was kept on him, and one morning he was seen to drive down\nto the west side of the bridge and tie his team behind a house, where\nhe thought they would be safe until he returned. As soon as the old\nman passed over the bridge the squad took possession of his horses,\nand when he returned the team was on the way to Abercrombie laden\nwith supplies for the troops at the fort. Of course the government\nsubsequently reimbursed the owners of the teams for their use, but in\nthis particular case the soldiers did not think the owner deserved it.\n\nGov. Ramsey's carriage team was early taken possession of by the\nmilitary squad, and when the driver gravely informed the officer in\ncharge that the governor was the owner of that team and he thought it\nexempt from military duty, he was suavely informed that"}
